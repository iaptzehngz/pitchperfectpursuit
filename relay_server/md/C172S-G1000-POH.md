approximately 2 knots. There is a corresponding difference
in range, while all other performance figures are
unchanged when speed fairings are installed.

The above performance figures are based on airplane weights at 2550
pounds, standard atmospheric conditions, level, hard-surfaced dry
runways and no wind. They are calculated values derived from flight
tests conducted by Cessna Aircraft Company under carefully
documented conditions and will vary with individual airplanes and
numerous factors affecting flight performance.

##### **WEIGHT AND BALANCE TERMINOLOGY**

Reference
Datum **Reference Datum** is an imaginary vertical plane from
which all horizontal distances are measured for
balance purposes.

Station **Station** is a location along the airplane fuselage given
in terms of the distance from the reference datum.

Arm **Arm** is the horizontal distance from the reference
datum to the center of gravity (C.G.) of an item.

Moment **Moment** is the product of the weight of an item
multiplied by its arm. (Moment divided by the constant
1000 is used in this POH to simplify balance
calculations by reducing the number of digits.)

Center of
Gravity
(C.G.) **Center of Gravity** is the point at which an airplane, or
equipment, would balance if suspended. Its distance
from the reference datum is found by dividing the total
moment by the total weight of the airplane.

C.G. Arm **Center of Gravity Arm** is the arm obtained by adding
the airplane's individual moments and dividing the sum
by the total weight.

C.G. Limits **Center of Gravity Limits** are the extreme center of
gravity locations within which the airplane must be
operated at a given weight.

Standard
Empty Weight **Standard Empty Weight** is the weight of a standard
airplane, including unusable fuel, full operating fluids
and full engine oil.

GFC 700 AFCS
#### MANEUVER LIMITS (Continued)
##### UTILITY CATEGORY (Continued)

Aerobatics that may impose high loads should not be attempted. The
important thing to bear in mind in flight maneuvers is that the airplane is
clean in aerodynamic design and will build up speed quickly with the
nose down. Proper speed control is an essential requirement for
execution of any maneuver, and care should always be exercised to
avoid excessive speed which in turn can impose excessive loads. In
the execution of all maneuvers, avoid abrupt use of controls.
#### **FLIGHT LOAD FACTOR LIMITS**
##### **NORMAL CATEGORY**

Flight Load Factors (Maximum Takeoff Weight - 2550 POUNDS):
*Flaps UP: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .+3.8g, -1.52g

unless the pilot verifies the currency of the database or verifies each
selected waypoint for accuracy by reference to current approved data.

RNAV/GPS instrument approaches must be accomplished in
accordance with approved instrument approach procedures that are
retrieved from the G1000 navigation database. The G1000 database
must incorporate the current update cycle.

Use of the NAVIGATION MAP page for pilotage navigation is
prohibited. The Navigation Map is intended only to enhance situational
awareness. Navigation is to be conducted using only current charts,
data and authorized navigation facilities.

Use of the TRAFFIC MAP to maneuver the airplane to avoid traffic is
prohibited. The Traffic Information System (TIS) is intended for advisory
use only. TIS is intended only to help the pilot to visually locate traffic. It
is the responsibility of the pilot to see and maneuver to avoid traffic.

Use of the TERRAIN PROXIMITY information for primary terrain
avoidance is prohibited. The Terrain Proximity map is intended only to
enhance situational awareness. It is the pilot’s responsibility to provide
terrain clearance at all times.

Navigation using the G1000 is not authorized north of 70° North latitude
or south of 70° South latitude due to unsuitability of the magnetic fields
near the Earth's poles. In addition, operations are not authorized in the
following two regions:

1. North of 65° North latitude between longitude 75° W and 120° W
(Northern Canada).
2. South of 55° South latitude between longitude 120° E and 165° E

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **INTRODUCTION**

Section 3 provides checklist and amplified procedures for coping with
emergencies that may occur. Emergencies caused by airplane or
engine malfunctions are extremely rare if proper preflight inspections
and maintenance are practiced. Enroute weather emergencies can be
minimized or eliminated by careful flight planning and good judgment
when unexpected weather is encountered. However, should an
emergency arise, the basic guidelines described in this section should
be considered and applied as necessary to correct the problem. In any
emergency situation, the most important task is continued control of the
airplane and maneuver to execute a successful landing.

Emergency procedures associated with optional or supplemental
equipment are found in Section 9, Supplements.

MODEL 172S NAV III EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **AMPLIFIED EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

The following Amplified Emergency Procedures provide additional
information beyond that in the Emergency Procedures Checklists
portion of this section. These procedures also include information not
readily adaptable to a checklist format, and material to which a pilot
could not be expected to refer in resolution of a specific emergency.
This information should be reviewed in detail prior to flying the airplane,
as well as reviewed on a regular basis to keep pilot’s knowledge of
procedures fresh.
#### **ENGINE FAILURE**

If an engine failure occurs during the takeoff roll, stop the airplane on
the remaining runway. Those extra items on the checklist will provide
added safety after a failure of this type.

If an engine failure occurs immediately after takeoff, in most cases, the
landing should be planned straight ahead with only small changes in
direction to avoid obstructions. Altitude and airspeed are seldom
sufficient to execute the 180° gliding turn necessary to return to the
runway. The checklist procedures assume that adequate time exists to
secure the fuel and ignition systems prior to touchdown.

After an engine failure in flight, the most important task is to continue
flying the airplane. The best glide speed, as shown in Figure 3-1,
should be established as quickly as possible. While gliding toward a
suitable landing area, an effort should be made to identify the cause of
the failure. If time permits, an engine restart should be attempted as
shown in the checklist. If the engine cannot be restarted, a forced
landing without power must be completed.

#### **FORCED LANDINGS**

If all attempts to restart the engine fail and a forced landing is imminent,
select a suitable field and prepare for the landing as discussed under
the Emergency Landing Without Engine Power checklist. Transmit
Mayday message on 121.5 MHz giving location, intentions and squawk
7700.

Before attempting an off airport landing with engine power available,
one should fly over the landing area at a safe, but low altitude, to
inspect the terrain for obstructions and surface conditions, proceeding
as discussed in the Precautionary Landing With Engine Power
checklist.

Prepare for ditching by securing or jettisoning heavy objects located in
the baggage area and collect folded coats for protection of occupants'
face at touchdown. Transmit Mayday messages on 121.5 MHz giving
location, intentions and squawk 7700. Avoid a landing flare because of
the difficulty in judging height over a water surface. The checklist
assumes the availability of power to make a precautionary water
landing. If power is not available, use of the airspeeds noted with
minimum flap extension will provide a more favorable attitude for a
power off ditching.

In a forced landing situation, do not turn off the MASTER switch,
AVIONICS switch or STBY BATT switch until a landing is assured.
Premature deactivation of the switches will disable all airplane electrical
systems.

Before completing a forced landing, especially in remote and
mountainous areas, activate the ELT by setting the cockpit-mounted
switch to the ON position. For complete information on ELT operation,
refer to Section 9, Supplements.

SECTION 3 CESSNA

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES MODEL 172S NAV III

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **LANDING WITHOUT ELEVATOR CONTROL**

Trim for horizontal flight with an airspeed of approximately 65 KIAS and
flaps set to 20° by using throttle and elevator trim controls. Then **do not**
**change the elevator trim control setting;** control the glide angle by
adjusting power.

During the landing flare (round-out), the nose will come down when
power is reduced and the airplane may touch down on the nosewheel
before the main wheels. When in the flare, the elevator trim control
should be adjusted toward the full nose up position and the power
adjusted at the same time so that the airplane will rotate to a horizontal
attitude for touchdown. Close the throttle at touchdown.
#### **FIRES**

Improper starting procedures involving the excessive use of auxiliary
fuel pump operation can cause engine flooding and subsequent
collection of fuel on the parking ramp as the excess fuel drains
overboard from the intake manifolds. This is sometimes experienced in
difficult starts in cold weather where engine preheat service is not
available. If this occurs, the airplane should be pushed away from the
fuel puddle before another engine start is attempted. Otherwise, there
is a possibility of raw fuel accumulations in the exhaust system igniting
during an engine start, causing a long flame from the tailpipe, and
possibly igniting the collected fuel on the pavement. If a fire occurs,
proceed according to the checklist.

Although engine fires are extremely rare in flight, if a fire is
encountered, the steps of the appropriate checklist should be followed.
After completion of the checklist procedure, execute a forced landing.
Do not attempt to restart the engine.

The first sign of an electrical fire is usually the smell of burning
insulation. The checklist procedure should result in the elimination of
the fire.

#### **EMERGENCY OPERATION IN CLOUDS **

If the engine-driven vacuum pump fails in flight, the standby attitude
indicator will not be accurate. The pilot must then rely on the attitude
and heading information (from the AHRS) shown on the PFD
indicators. With valid HDG or GPS/NAV inputs, autopilot operation will
not be affected.

If the AHRS unit fails in flight (red X’s shown through the PFD attitude
and heading indicators), the pilot must rely on the standby attitude
indicator and non-stabilized magnetic compass for attitude and heading
information.

The autopilot will not operate if the AHRS unit fails. The pilot must
manually fly the airplane without AHRS input. Refer to Section 7,
Airplane and Systems Description, for additional details on autopilot
operations.

The following instructions assume that the pilot is not very proficient at
instrument flying and is flying the airplane without the autopilot
engaged.
##### **EXECUTING A 180° TURN IN CLOUDS (AHRS FAILED)**

Upon inadvertently entering the clouds, an immediate turn to reverse
course and return to VFR conditions should be made as follows:

**AHRS FAILURE**
1. Note the non-stabilized magnetic compass heading.
2. Using the standby attitude indicator, initiate a 15° bank left turn.
Keep feet off rudder pedals. Maintain altitude and 15° bank
angle. Continue the turn for 60 seconds, then roll back to level
flight.
3. When the compass card becomes sufficiently stable, check the
accuracy of the turn by verifying that the compass heading
approximates the reciprocal of the original heading.
4. If necessary, adjust the heading by keeping the wings level and
using the rudder to make skidding turns (the compass will read
more accurately) to complete the course reversal.
5. Maintain altitude and airspeed by cautious application of
elevator control. Keep the roll pointer and index aligned and
steer only with rudder.

##### **EMERGENCY DESCENT THROUGH CLOUDS (AHRS** **FAILED)**

When returning to VFR flight after a 180° turn is not practical, a descent
through the clouds to VFR conditions below may be appropriate. If
possible, obtain an ATC clearance for an emergency descent through
the clouds.

**AHRS FAILURE**

Choose an easterly or westerly heading to minimize non-stabilized
magnetic compass card sensitivity. Occasionally check the compass
heading and make minor corrections to hold an approximate course.
The autopilot will not operate if the AHRS unit fails. The pilot must
manually fly the airplane without AHRS input.

Before descending into the clouds, prepare for a stabilized descent as
follows:
1. Apply full rich mixture.
2. Turn pitot heat on.
3. Set power for a 500 to 800 feet per minute rate of descent.
4. Set the elevator trim for a stabilized descent at 80 KIAS.
5. Use the standby attitude indicator roll pointer and index to keep
wings level.
6. Check trend of compass card movement and make cautious
corrections with rudder to stop the turn.
7. Upon breaking out of clouds, resume normal cruising flight.

align the roll index and roll pointer of the standby attitude
indicator.
4. Cautiously apply elevator back pressure to slowly reduce the
airspeed to 80 KIAS.
5. Adjust the elevator trim control to maintain an 80 KIAS glide.
6. Use aileron control to maintain wings level (keep roll pointer and
index aligned) and constant heading.
7. Resume Emergency Descent Through The Clouds procedure.
8. Upon breaking out of clouds, resume normal cruising flight.
#### **INADVERTENT FLIGHT INTO ICING CONDITIONS**

Flight into icing conditions is prohibited and extremely dangerous. An
inadvertent encounter with these conditions can be resolved using the
checklist procedures. The best action is to turn back or change altitude
to escape icing conditions. Set the PITOT HEAT switch to the ON
position until safely out of icing conditions.

During these encounters, an unexplained loss of engine power could
be caused by ice blocking the air intake filter or in extremely rare
instances ice completely blocking the fuel injection air reference tubes.
In either case, the throttle should be positioned to obtain maximum
RPM (in some instances, the throttle may need to be retarded for
maximum power). The mixture should then be adjusted, as required, to
obtain maximum RPM.

#### **STATIC SOURCE BLOCKED**

If erroneous readings of the static source instruments (airspeed,
altimeter and vertical speed) are suspected, the alternate static source
air valve (ALT STATIC AIR) should be pulled ON, thereby supplying
static pressure to these instruments from the cabin.

When the ALT STATIC AIR valve is ON, the maximum airspeed
variation from normal static source operation is 11 knots and the
maximum altimeter variation is 50 feet with all windows closed. Refer to
Section 5, Figure 5-1 (Sheet 2), Airspeed Calibration - Alternate Static
Source correction tables for additional details.
#### **SPINS**

Should an inadvertent spin occur, the following recovery procedure
should be used:

1. RETARD THROTTLE TO IDLE POSITION.

2. PLACE AILERONS IN NEUTRAL POSITION.

3. APPLY AND **HOLD** FULL RUDDER OPPOSITE TO THE
DIRECTION OF ROTATION.
4. JUST **AFTER** THE RUDDER REACHES THE STOP, MOVE
THE CONTROL WHEEL **BRISKLY** FORWARD FAR ENOUGH
TO BREAK THE STALL. Full down elevator may be required at
aft center of gravity loadings to assure optimum recoveries.
5. **HOLD** THESE CONTROL INPUTS UNTIL ROTATION STOPS.
Premature relaxation of the control inputs may extend the
recovery.
6. AS ROTATION STOPS, NEUTRALIZE RUDDER, AND MAKE A
SMOOTH RECOVERY FROM THE RESULTING DIVE.

**NOTE**

If the rate of the spin makes determining the direction of
rotation difficult, the magenta turn rate indicator at the top of
the HSI compass card will show the rate and direction of
the turn. The HSI compass card will rotate in the opposite
direction. Hold opposite rudder to the turn vector direction.

For additional information on spins and spin recovery, see the
discussion under SPINS in Normal Procedures, Section 4.

#### **ROUGH ENGINE OPERATION OR LOSS OF POWER**
##### **SPARK PLUG FOULING**

A slight engine roughness in flight may be caused by one or more spark
plugs becoming fouled by carbon or lead deposits. This may be verified
by turning the MAGNETOS switch momentarily from BOTH to either L
or R position. An obvious power loss in single magneto operation is
evidence of spark plug or magneto trouble. Since spark plugs are the
more likely cause, lean the mixture to the recommended lean setting for
cruising flight. If the problem does not clear up in several minutes,
determine if a richer mixture setting will produce smoother operation. If
not, proceed to the nearest airport for repairs using the BOTH position
of the MAGNETOS switch unless extreme roughness makes the use of
a single MAGNETO position necessary.
##### **MAGNETO MALFUNCTION**

Sudden engine roughness or misfiring is usually a sign of a magneto
problem. Changing the MAGNETOS switch from BOTH to the L and R
switch positions will identify which magneto is malfunctioning. Select
different power settings and enrichen the mixture to determine if
continued operation on BOTH magnetos is possible. If not, change to
the good magneto and continue to the nearest airport for repairs.
##### **IDLE POWER ENGINE ROUGHNESS**

**(As Required by AD 2001-06-17, Paragraph (d)(3))**

An excessively rich idle fuel flow may cause low speed engine
roughness during flight. During most in-flight low engine speeds (power
off stalls, approach to landing, etc.), the mixture control is normally in
the full-rich position. However, to improve engine roughness (caused
by an improperly adjusted fuel servo) during low engine speeds while in
flight, you should rotate the vernier mixture control (leaning of fuel
mixture). You may also have to lean the fuel mixture if this low engine
speed results in power loss and you need to restart the engine during
flight. In all cases, you should land the airplane at the nearest airport for
repairs if low speed engine roughness requires you to adjust the fuel
mixture control to improve engine operation.

#### **ROUGH ENGINE OPERATION OR LOSS OF POWER**

(Continued)
##### **ENGINE-DRIVEN FUEL PUMP FAILURE**

Failure of the engine-driven fuel pump will be shown by a sudden
reduction in the fuel flow indication (FFLOW GPH) **immediately before**
**a loss of power** while operating from a fuel tank containing adequate
fuel.

If the engine-driven fuel pump fails, immediately set the FUEL PUMP
switch to the ON position to restore the engine power. The flight should
be terminated as soon as practical and the engine-driven fuel pump
repaired.
##### **EXCESSIVE FUEL VAPOR**

Fuel vapor in the fuel injection system is most likely to occur on the
ground, typically during prolonged taxi operations, when operating at
higher altitudes and/or in unusually warm temperatures.

Excessive fuel vapor accumulation is shown by fuel flow indicator
(FFLOW GPH) fluctuations greater than 1 gal./hr. This condition, with
leaner mixtures or with larger fluctuations, can result in power surges,
and if not corrected, may cause power loss.

To slow vapor formation and stabilize fuel flow on the ground or in the
air, set the FUEL PUMP switch to the ON position and adjust the
mixture as required for smooth engine operation. If vapor symptoms
continue, select the opposite fuel tank. When fuel flow stabilizes, set
the FUEL PUMP switch to the OFF position and adjust the mixture as
desired.

##### **LOW OIL PRESSURE**

If the low oil pressure annunciator (OIL PRESS) comes on, check the
oil pressure indicator (OIL PRES on ENGINE page or OIL PSI on
SYSTEM page) to confirm low oil pressure condition. If oil pressure and
oil temperature (OIL TEMP on ENGINE page or OIL °F on SYSTEM
page) remain normal, it is possible that the oil pressure sending unit or
relief valve is malfunctioning. Land at the nearest airport to determine
the source of the problem.

If a total loss of oil pressure and a rise in oil temperature occur at about
the same time, it could mean that the engine is about to fail. Reduce
power immediately and select a field suitable for a forced landing. Use
only the minimum power necessary to reach the landing site.

#### **ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM** **MALFUNCTIONS**

Malfunctions in the electrical power supply system can be detected
through regular monitoring of the main battery ammeter (M BATT
AMPS) and the main electrical bus voltmeter (M BUS VOLTS);
however, the cause of these malfunctions is usually difficult to
determine. A broken alternator drive belt, too much wear on the
alternator brushes, or an error in wiring is most likely the cause of
alternator failures, although other factors could cause the problem. A
defective Alternator Control Unit (ACU) can also cause malfunctions.
Problems of this nature constitute an electrical emergency and should
be dealt with immediately. Electrical power malfunctions usually fall into
two categories: excessive rate of charge and insufficient rate of charge.
The following paragraphs describe the recommended remedy for each
situation.
##### **EXCESSIVE RATE OF CHARGE**

After engine starting and heavy electrical usage at low engine speeds
(such as extended taxiing), the battery condition will be low enough to
accept above normal charging during the initial part of a flight.
However, after thirty minutes of cruising flight, the main battery
ammeter (M BATT AMPS) should be indicating less than 5 amps of
charging (+) current. If the charging current remains above this value
on a long flight, the battery electrolyte could overheat and evaporate.

Electronic components in the electrical system can be adversely
affected by higher than normal voltage. The ACU includes an
overvoltage sensor circuit which will automatically disconnect the
alternator if the charge voltage increases to more than approximately
31.75 volts. If the overvoltage sensor circuit does not operate correctly,
as shown by voltage more than 31.75 volts on the main battery bus
voltmeter, the MASTER switch ALT section should be set to the OFF
position. Unnecessary electrical equipment should be de-energized
and the flight terminated as soon as practical.

#### **ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM** MALFUNCTIONS (Continued)
##### **INSUFFICIENT RATE OF CHARGE**

When the overvoltage sensor circuit, or other fault, opens the alternator
(ALT FIELD) circuit breaker and de-energizes the alternator, a
discharge (-) current will be shown on the main battery ammeter and
the low voltage annunciator (LOW VOLTS) will come on. The ACU can
de-energize the alternator due to minor disturbances in the electrical
system, resulting in a nuisance opening of the ALT FIELD circuit
breaker. If this happens, an attempt should be made to energize the
alternator system.

To energize the alternator system
1. MASTER Switch (ALT Only) - OFF
2. ALT FIELD Circuit Breaker - CHECK IN
3. MASTER Switch (ALT Only) - ON

If the problem was a minor ACU disturbance in the electrical system,
normal main battery charging will start. A charge (+) current will be
shown on the main battery ammeter and the LOW VOLTS annunciator
will go off.

If the LOW VOLTS annunciator comes on again, there is an alternator
system problem. Do not repeat steps to energize the alternator system.
The electrical load on the battery must be minimized (by de-energizing
nonessential electrical equipment and avionics) because the battery
can supply the electrical system for only a short time. Reduce electrical
load as soon as possible to extend the life of the battery for landing.
Land as soon as practical.

#### **ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM** MALFUNCTIONS (Continued)
##### INSUFFICIENT RATE OF CHARGE (Continued)

Main battery life can be extended by setting the MASTER switch (ALT
and BAT) to OFF and operating the equipment on the ESS BUS from
the standby battery. The standby battery is only capable of providing
power for systems on the essential bus and cannot provide power for
transponder (XPDR) operation. Main battery life should be extended,
when practical, for possible later operation of the wing flaps and use of
the landing light (at night).

**NOTE**

The LOW VOLTS annunciator can come on when the
engine is operated at low RPM with a high electrical load.
The LOW VOLTS annunciator will usually go off when the
engine is operated at higher RPM for greater alternator
system output. Make sure that the M BATT AMPS
indication shows positive (+) current at the higher RPM.

#### **HIGH CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) LEVEL** **ANNUNCIATION**

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless product of an
internal combustion engine and is always present in exhaust fumes.
Even minute quantities of carbon monoxide breathed over a long
period of time may lead to dire consequences. The symptoms of
carbon monoxide poisoning are difficult to detect by the person affected
and may include blurred thinking, a feeling of uneasiness, dizziness,
headache, and loss of consciousness.

The cabin heater system operates by allowing ambient air to flow
through an exhaust shroud where it is heated before being ducted into
the cabin. If an exhaust leak, caused by a crack in the exhaust pipe,
occurs in the area surrounded by this shroud it would allow exhaust
fumes to mix with the heated ambient air being ducted into the cabin.
Therefore, if anyone in the cabin smells exhaust fumes, experiences
any of the symptoms mentioned above, or the CO LVL HIGH warning
annunciation comes on when using the cabin heater, immediately turn
off the cabin heater and preform the emergency items for High Carbon
Monoxide (CO) Level Advisory.

When the CO detection system senses a CO level of 50 parts per
million (PPM) by volume or greater, the alarm turns on a flashing
warning annunciation CO LVL HIGH in the annunciation window on the
PFD with a continuous tone until the PFD softkey below WARNING is
pushed. It then remains on steady until the CO level drops below 50
PPM and automatically resets the alarm.
#### **OTHER EMERGENCIES**
##### **WINDSHIELD DAMAGE**

If a bird strike or other incident should damage the windshield in flight to
the point of creating an opening, a significant loss in performance may
be expected. This loss may be minimized in some cases (depending on
amount of damage, altitude, etc.) by opening the side windows while
the airplane is maneuvered for a landing at the nearest airport. If
airplane performance or other adverse conditions prevent landing at an
airport, prepare for an off airport landing in accordance with the
Precautionary Landing With Engine Power or Ditching checklists.

**NOTE**

Visually check airplane for general condition during walkaround inspection. Airplane should be parked in a normal
ground attitude (refer to Figure 1-1) to make sure that fuel
drain valves allow for accurate sampling. Use of the
refueling steps and assist handles will simplify access to
the upper wing surfaces for visual checks and refueling
operations. In cold weather, remove even small
accumulations of frost, ice or snow from wing, tail and
control surfaces. Also, make sure that control surfaces
contain no internal accumulations of ice or debris. Prior to
flight, check that pitot heater is warm to touch within 30
seconds with battery and pitot heat switches on. If a night
flight is planned, check operation of all lights, and make
sure a flashlight is available.

MODEL 172S NAV III NORMAL PROCEDURES

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **AMPLIFIED NORMAL PROCEDURES** **PREFLIGHT INSPECTION**

The preflight inspection, described in Figure 4-1 and adjacent checklist,
is required prior to each flight. If the airplane has been in extended
storage, has had recent major maintenance, or has been operated from
rough runways, a more extensive exterior inspection is recommended.

Before every flight, check the condition of main and nose landing gear
tires. Keep tires inflated to the pressure specified in Section 8, Airplane
Handling, Service And Maintenance. Examine tire sidewalls for
patterns of shallow cracks called weather checks. These cracks are
evidence of tire deterioration caused by age, improper storage, or
prolonged exposure to weather. Check the tread of the tire for depth,
wear, and cuts. Replace the tire if fibers are visible.

After major maintenance has been performed, the flight and trim tab
controls should be double checked for free and correct movement and
security. The security of all inspection plates on the airplane should be
checked following periodic inspections. If the airplane has been waxed
or polished, check the external static pressure source hole for
stoppage.

If the airplane has been kept in a crowded hangar, it should be checked
for dents and scratches on wings, fuselage, and tail surfaces, damage
to navigation, strobe lights, and avionics antennas. Check for damage
to the nosewheel steering system, the result of exceeding nosewheel
turning limits while towing.

SECTION 4 CESSNA

NORMAL PROCEDURES MODEL 172S NAV III

GFC 700 AFCS
#### PREFLIGHT INSPECTION (Continued)

Outside storage for long periods may result in dust and dirt
accumulation on the induction air filter, obstructions in airspeed system
lines, water contaminants in fuel tanks, and insect/bird/rodent nests in
any opening. If any water is detected in the fuel system, the fuel tank
sump quick drain valves, fuel reservoir quick drain valve, and fuel
strainer quick drain valve should all be thoroughly drained again. The
wings should then be gently rocked and the tail lowered to the ground
to move any further contaminants to the sampling points. Repeated
samples should then be taken at **all** quick drain points until **all**
contamination has been removed. If, after repeated sampling, evidence
of contamination still exists, the fuel tanks should be completely drained
and the fuel system cleaned.

If the airplane has been stored outside in windy or gusty areas, or tied
down adjacent to taxiing airplanes, special attention should be paid to
control surface stops, hinges, and brackets to detect the presence of
potential wind damage.

If the airplane has been operated from muddy fields or in snow or slush,
check the main and nose gear wheel fairings for obstructions and
cleanliness. Operation from a gravel or cinder field will require extra
attention to propeller tips and abrasion on leading edges of the
horizontal tail. Stone damage to the propeller can seriously reduce the
fatigue life of the blades.

Airplanes that are operated from rough fields, especially at high
altitudes, are subjected to abnormal landing gear abuse. Frequently
check all components of the landing gear, shock strut, tires, and
brakes. If the shock strut is insufficiently extended, undue landing and
taxi loads will be subjected to the airplane structure.

To prevent loss of fuel in flight, make sure the fuel tank filler caps are
tightly sealed after any fuel system check or servicing. Fuel system
vents should also be inspected for obstructions, ice or water, especially
after exposure to cold, wet weather.

rapidly following engine shutdown and the injector nozzle lines remain
nearly full of fuel.

In warmer weather, engine compartment temperatures may increase
rapidly following engine shutdown, and fuel in the lines will vaporize
and escape into the intake manifold. Hot weather starting procedures
depend considerably on how soon the next engine start is attempted.
Within the first 20 to 30 minutes after shutdown, the fuel manifold is
adequately primed and the empty injector nozzle lines will fill before the
engine dies. However, after approximately 30 minutes, the vaporized
fuel in the manifold will have nearly dissipated and some slight priming
could be required to refill the nozzle lines and keep the engine running
after the initial start. Starting a hot engine is facilitated by advancing the
mixture control promptly to 1/3 open when the engine starts, and then
smoothly to full rich as power develops.

If the engine does not continue to run, set the FUEL PUMP switch to
the ON position temporarily and adjust the throttle and/or mixture as
necessary to keep the engine running. In the event of over priming or
flooding, set the FUEL PUMP switch to OFF, open the throttle from 1/2
to full open, and continue cranking with the mixture in the IDLE
CUTOFF position (pull full out). When the engine fires, smoothly
advance the mixture control to full rich and retard the throttle to desired
idle speed.

If the engine is under primed (most likely in cold weather with a cold
engine), it will not start at all, and additional priming will be necessary.

After starting, if the oil pressure gage does not begin to show pressure
within 30 seconds in warmer temperatures and approximately one
minute in very cold weather, stop the engine and find the cause before
continued operation. Lack of oil pressure can cause serious engine
damage.

**NOTE**

Additional details concerning cold weather starting and
operation may be found under COLD WEATHER
OPERATION paragraphs in this section.

##### **RECOMMENDED STARTER DUTY CYCLE**

Operate the starter motor for 10 seconds followed by a 20 second cool
down period. This cycle can be repeated two additional times, followed
by a ten minute cool down period before resuming cranking. After cool
down, operate the starter motor again, three cycles of 10 seconds
followed by 20 seconds of cool down. If the engine still does not start,
try to find the cause.
#### **LEANING FOR GROUND OPERATIONS**

For all ground operations, after starting the engine and when the
engine is running smoothly:

1. Set the throttle control to 1200 RPM.

2. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM.
3. Set the throttle control to an RPM appropriate for ground
operations (800 to 1000 RPM recommended).

**NOTE**

If ground operation will be required after the BEFORE
TAKEOFF checklist is completed, lean the mixture again
(as described above) until ready for the TAKEOFF

#### **TAXIING**

When taxiing, it is important that speed and use of brakes be held to a
minimum and that all controls be utilized (refer to Figure 4-2, Taxiing
Diagram) to maintain directional control and balance.

Taxiing over loose gravel or cinders should be done at low engine
speed to avoid abrasion and stone damage to the propeller tips.

**NOTE**

The LOW VOLTS annunciator may come on when the
engine is operated at low RPM with a high load on the
electrical system. If this is the case, the LOW VOLTS
annunciator will go off when the engine is run at higher
RPM to provide greater alternator system output. Verify that
the M BATT AMPS indication shows positive (charging)
current at the higher RPM.

#### **BEFORE TAKEOFF**
##### **WARM UP**

If the engine idles, with the throttle against the idle stop, (approximately
600 RPM) and accelerates smoothly, the engine is warm enough for
takeoff. Since the engine is closely cowled for efficient in-flight engine
cooling, the airplane should be pointed into the wind to avoid
overheating during prolonged engine operation on the ground. Long
periods of idling may cause fouled spark plugs.
##### **MAGNETO CHECK**

The magneto check must be made at 1800 RPM. Turn the
MAGNETOS switch from the BOTH position to the R position. Note the
new RPM, then turn the MAGNETOS switch back to the BOTH position
to clear the spark plugs. Turn the MAGNETOS switch to the L position,
note the new RPM, then turn the switch back to the BOTH position.
RPM decrease should not be more than 150 RPM on either magneto or
be greater than 50 RPM differential between magnetos. If there is a
doubt concerning operation of the ignition system, RPM checks at
higher engine speeds will usually confirm whether a deficiency exists.

No RPM drop may indicate a faulty ground to one magneto or magneto
timing set in advance of the angle specified.
##### **ALTERNATOR CHECK**

Make sure that both the alternator and alternator control unit are
operating properly before night or instrument flight, or flights where
electrical power is essential. Check the electrical system during the
MAGNETO check (1800 RPM) by setting all electrical equipment
required for the flight to the ON position. When the alternator and
alternator control unit are both operating properly, the ammeters will
show zero or positive current (amps), the voltmeters should show
between 27 to 29 volts, and no electrical system annunciations will
appear. Reduce the electrical load before reducing engine speed so the
battery will not discharge while the engine is at idle.

#### BEFORE TAKEOFF (Continued)
##### **ELEVATOR TRIM**

The elevator trim tab is in the takeoff position when the trim pointer is
aligned with the index mark on the pedestal cover. Adjust the trim
wheel during flight as necessary to make control wheel forces more
neutral.
##### **LANDING LIGHTS**

It is recommended that only the taxi light be used to enhance the
visibility of the airplane in the traffic pattern or enroute. This will extend
the service life of the landing light.
#### **TAKEOFF**
##### **POWER CHECK**

It is important to check full throttle engine operation early in the takeoff
roll. Any sign of rough engine operation or sluggish engine acceleration
is good cause for discontinuing the takeoff. If this occurs, you are
justified in making a thorough full throttle static run-up before another
takeoff is attempted. The engine should run smoothly and turn
approximately 2300 - 2400 RPM with the mixture leaned to provide
maximum RPM.

Full throttle run-ups over loose gravel are especially harmful to
propeller tips. When takeoffs must be made over a gravel surface,
advance the throttle slowly. This allows the airplane to start rolling
before high RPM is developed, and the gravel will be blown behind the
propeller rather than pulled into it.

Prior to takeoff from fields above 3000 feet pressure altitude, the
mixture should be leaned to give maximum RPM at full throttle, with the
airplane not moving.

After full throttle is applied, adjust the throttle friction lock clockwise to
prevent the throttle from moving back from a maximum power position.
Similar friction lock adjustments should be made as required in other
flight conditions to hold the throttle setting.

CESSNA SECTION 4

MODEL 172S NAV III NORMAL PROCEDURES

#### TAKEOFF (Continued)
##### **WING FLAP SETTINGS**

Normal takeoffs use wing flaps UP - 10°. Using 10° wing flaps reduces
the ground roll and total distance over an obstacle by approximately 10
percent. **Flap deflections greater than 10° are not approved for**
**takeoff.** If 10° wing flaps are used for takeoff, the flaps should stay at
10° until all obstacles are cleared and a safe flap retraction speed of 60
KIAS is reached. For a short field, 10° wing flaps and an obstacle
clearance speed of 56 KIAS should be used.

Soft or rough field takeoffs are performed with 10° flaps by lifting the
airplane off the ground as soon as practical in a slightly tail low attitude.
If no obstacles are ahead, the airplane should be leveled off
immediately to accelerate to a higher climb speed. When departing a
soft field with an aft C.G. loading, the elevator trim control should be
adjusted towards the nose down direction to give comfortable control
wheel forces during the initial climb.
##### **CROSSWIND TAKEOFF**

Takeoffs under strong crosswind conditions normally are performed
with the minimum flap setting necessary for the field length, to minimize
the drift angle immediately after takeoff. With the ailerons partially
deflected into the wind, the airplane is accelerated to a speed slightly
higher than normal, then the elevator control is used to quickly, but
carefully, lift the airplane off the ground and to prevent possible settling
back to the runway while drifting. When clear of the ground, make a
coordinated turn into the wind to correct for drift.

NORMAL PROCEDURES MODEL 172S NAV III

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **ENROUTE CLIMB**

Normal enroute climbs are performed with flaps up, at full throttle and
75 to 85 KIAS for the best combination of performance, visibility and
engine cooling. The mixture should be full rich during climb at altitudes
up to 3000 feet pressure altitude. Above 3000 feet pressure altitude,
the mixture can be leaned as needed for increased power or to provide
smoother engine operation.

If it is necessary to climb more rapidly to clear mountains or reach
favorable winds at higher altitudes, the best rate of climb speed should
be used with Maximum Continuous Power (MCP). This speed is 74
KIAS at sea level, decreasing to 72 KIAS at 10,000 feet.

If an obstruction dictates the use of a steep climb angle, the best angle
of climb speed should be used with flaps UP and MCP. This speed is 62
KIAS at sea level, increasing to 67 KIAS at 10,000 feet. This type of
climb should be of the minimum duration and engine temperatures
should be carefully monitored due to the low climb speed.

#### **CRUISE**

Normal cruise is performed between 45% and 75% power. The engine
RPM and corresponding fuel consumption for various altitudes can be
determined by using the data in Section 5.

**NOTE**

Cruise flight should use 75% power as much as possible
until the engine has operated for a total of 50 hours or oil
consumption has stabilized. Operation at this higher power
will ensure proper seating of the piston rings and is
applicable to new engines, and engines in service following
cylinder replacement or top overhaul of one or more
cylinders.

The Cruise Performance charts in Section 5 provide the pilot with flight
planning information for the Model 172S in still air with speed fairings
installed. Power, altitude, and winds determine the time and fuel
needed to complete any flight.

The Cruise Performance Table, Figure 4-3, shows the true airspeed
and nautical miles per gallon during cruise for various altitudes and
percent powers, and is based on standard conditions and zero wind.
This table should be used as a guide, along with the available winds
aloft information, to determine the most favorable altitude and power
setting for a given trip. The selection of cruise altitude on the basis of
the most favorable wind conditions and the use of low power settings
are significant factors that should be considered on every trip to reduce
fuel consumption.

In addition to power settings, proper leaning techniques also contribute
to greater range and are figured into cruise performance tables. To
achieve the recommended lean mixture fuel consumption figures
shown in Section 5, the mixture should be leaned using the Exhaust
Gas Temperature (EGT) indicator as noted.

Figure 4-3

The Cruise Performance charts in Section 5 provide the pilot with
cruise performance at maximum gross weight. When normal cruise is
performed at reduced weights there is an increase in true airspeed.
During normal cruise at power settings between 55% and 75%, the true
airspeed will increase approximately 1 knot for every 150 pounds below
maximum gross weight. During normal cruise at power settings below
65%, the true airspeed will increase approximately 1 knot for every 125
pounds below maximum gross weight.

The fuel injection system employed on this engine is considered to be
non-icing. In the event that unusual conditions cause the intake air filter
to become clogged or iced over, an alternate intake air door opens
automatically for the most efficient use of either normal or alternate air,
depending on the amount of filter blockage. Due to the lower intake
pressure available through the alternate air door or a partially blocked
filter, engine RPM can decrease from a cruise power setting. This RPM
loss should be recovered by increasing the throttle setting to maintain
desired power.

##### **LEANING USING EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURE (EGT)**

The cruise performance data in this POH is based on the
recommended lean mixture setting determined from the maximum or
peak EGT at power settings of 75% MCP and lower. The 172S Nav III
provides EGT indications for all (4) engine cylinders. The ability to
monitor all cylinders is an aid in early identification and correction of
fuel injection problems.

**NOTE**

All engine cylinders do not receive identical fuel/air mixtures
(due to unequal intake pipe lengths, uneven intake air
temperatures, fuel injection nozzle tolerances etc.).
However, all cylinder EGTs should be within approximately
100°F of each other during normal operations. An EGT
difference greater than 100°F between cylinders indicates
that fuel injection system maintenance is necessary.

EGT is displayed on the EIS ENGINE and LEAN pages. The ENGINE
page has a horizontal scale with a temperature indicator (inverted
triangle) with a number representing the cylinder with the highest EGT.

The EIS LEAN page provides vertical bar graph displays showing EGT
for all cylinders. The cylinder with the highest EGT is shown in cyan
(light blue). The numerical value for the highest EGT is located below
the bar. The EGT and Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT) value for any
cylinder may be shown by using the CYL SLCT softkey to select the
desired cylinder. After a short period without CYL SLCT softkey activity,
automatic indication of the highest EGT and CHT will start again.

To aid in leaning the mixture, push the ENGINE, LEAN and ASSIST
softkeys, Δ PEAK °F will display below the EGT °F numerical value.
Lean the mixture by slowly turning the mixture control knob in the
counterclockwise direction while monitoring EGTs. As EGTs increase,
continue to lean the mixture until the hottest (cyan) cylinder reaches
peak EGT. This is identified by the EGT bar graph for that cylinder
changing to cyan with a hollow bar at the top. Note the Δ PEAK °F and
FFLOW GPH values for the first peaked cylinder. Peak EGT is
represented by Δ PEAK 0°F, if Δ PEAK °F value is negative (-) the
mixture can be on the lean side of peak. Enrichen the mixture by slowly
turning the mixture control clockwise and monitor both fuel flow and
EGTs until the leanest cylinder returns to peak EGT ( Δ PEAK 0°F) or
desired setting based on the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) Table,
Figure 4-4.

Δ PEAK °F values rich of peak will also be a negative (-) value (-50°F).
The lean assist system calculation is defined such that the peak EGT is
the highest value and any lesser value is represented with a negative () value, whether on the lean or rich side of the peak.

**NOTE**

The 172S engine manufacturer, Textron Lycoming, has not
approved operation of the engine at fuel flow rates (mixture
settings) less than necessary to reach peak EGT in the
leanest cylinder (the first cylinder to reach peak EGT). Use
FULL RICH mixture when operating the engine above 75%

Operation at peak EGT provides the best fuel economy. This results in

**NOTE**
### • Any change in altitude or power setting will require a

change in the recommended lean mixture setting and a
recheck of the EGT setting.
### • The EGT indicators take several seconds, after a mixture

adjustment, to start to show EGT changes. Finding peak
EGT and adjusting the mixture to the applicable setting
should take approximately one minute when the

##### **FUEL SAVINGS PROCEDURES FOR FLIGHT TRAINING** **OPERATIONS**

For best fuel economy during flight training operations, the following
procedures are recommended.

1. After engine start and for all ground operations, set the throttle to
1200 RPM and lean the mixture for maximum RPM. After
leaning, set the throttle to the appropriate RPM for ground
operations. Leave the mixture at this setting until beginning the
BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist. After the BEFORE TAKEOFF
checklist is complete, lean the mixture again as described above
until ready to perform the TAKEOFF checklist.

2. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM during full throttle climbs
above 3000 feet. The mixture may remain leaned (maximum
RPM at full throttle) for practicing maneuvers such as stalls and
slow flight.

3. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM during all operations at any
altitude, including those below 3000 feet, when using 75% or
less power.

**NOTE**
### • When cruising or maneuvering at 75% power or less, the

mixture may be further leaned until the EGT indicator
peaks and is then enrichened 50°F. This is especially
applicable to cross-country training flights, but should be
practiced during transition flight to and from the practice
area as well.
### • Using the above recommended procedures can provide

fuel savings in excess of 5% when compared to typical
training operations at full rich mixture. In addition, the
above procedures will minimize spark plug fouling since
the reduction in fuel consumption results in a
proportional reduction in tetraethyl lead passing through
the engine.

#### CRUISE (Continued)
##### **FUEL VAPOR PROCEDURES**

The engine fuel system can cause fuel vapor formation on the ground
during warm weather. This will generally occur when the outside
ambient air temperature is above 80°F. Vapor formation may increase
when the engine fuel flows are lower at idle and taxi engine speeds.
The following procedures are recommended when engine idle speed
and fuel flow fluctuations show that fuel vapor may be present:

1. With the mixture full rich, set the throttle at 1800 RPM to 2000
RPM. Maintain this power setting for 1 to 2 minutes or until
smooth engine operation returns.

2. Retard the throttle to idle to verify normal engine operation.

3. Advance the throttle to 1200 RPM and lean the mixture as
described under FUEL SAVINGS PROCEDURES FOR FLIGHT
TRAINING OPERATIONS.

4. In addition to the above procedures, the auxiliary fuel pump may
be turned ON with the mixture adjusted as required to aid vapor
suppression during ground operations. The auxiliary fuel pump
should be turned OFF prior to takeoff.
5. Just prior to TAKEOFF, apply full throttle for approximately 10
seconds to verify smooth engine operation for takeoff.

**NOTE**

When the engine is operated above 1800 RPM, the
resulting increased fuel flow results in lower fuel
temperatures throughout the engine fuel system. This
increased flow purges the fuel vapor and the cooler fuel
minimizes vapor formation.

Section 4 -Take note of the hot weather operational notes and
procedures in both the checklist and the amplified

#### **STALLS**

The stall characteristics are conventional and aural warning is provided
by a stall warning horn which sounds between 5 and 10 knots above
the stall in all configurations.

Power off stall speeds at maximum weight for both forward and aft C.G.
positions are presented in Section 5.
#### **SPINS**

Intentional spins are approved when the airplane is operated in the
utility category. Spins with baggage loadings or occupied rear seat(s)
are not approved.

However, before attempting to perform spins several items should be
carefully considered to assure a safe flight. No spins should be
attempted without first having received dual instruction both in spin
entries and spin recoveries from a qualified instructor who is familiar
with the spin characteristics of the Cessna 172S NAV III airplane.

The cabin should be clean and all loose equipment (including the
microphone and rear seat belts) should be stowed or secured. For a
solo flight in which spins will be conducted, the front passenger's seat
belt and shoulder harness should also be secured. Care should be
taken to ensure that the pilot can easily reach the flight controls and
produce maximum control travels.

CESSNA SECTION 4

MODEL 172S NAV III NORMAL PROCEDURES

GFC 700 AFCS
#### SPINS (Continued)

It is recommended that entries be accomplished at high enough altitude
that recoveries are completed 4000 feet or more Above Ground Level
(AGL). At least 1000 feet of altitude loss should be allowed for a 1-turn
spin and recovery, while a 6-turn spin and recovery may require
somewhat more than twice that amount. For example, the
recommended entry altitude for a 6-turn spin would be 6000 feet AGL.
In any case, entries should be planned so that recoveries are
completed well above the minimum 1500 feet AGL required by 14 CFR
91.303. Another reason for using high altitudes for practicing spins is
that a greater field of view is provided which will assist in maintaining
pilot orientation.

The normal entry is made from a power off stall. As the stall is
approached, the elevator control should be smoothly pulled to the full
aft position. Just prior to reaching the stall "break", rudder control in the
desired direction of the spin rotation should be applied so that full
rudder deflection is reached almost simultaneously with reaching full aft
elevator. A slightly greater rate of deceleration than for normal stall
entries, application of ailerons in the direction of the desired spin, and
the use of power at the entry will assure more consistent and positive
entries to the spin. As the airplane begins to spin, reduce the power to
idle and return the ailerons to neutral. Both elevator and rudder controls
should be held full with the spin until the spin recovery is initiated. An
inadvertent relaxation of either of these controls could result in the
development of a nose down spiral.

For the purpose of training in spins and spin recoveries, a 1 or 2 turn
spin is adequate and should be used. Up to 2 turns, the spin will
progress to a fairly rapid rate of rotation and a steep attitude.
Application of recovery controls will produce prompt recoveries (within
1/4 turn). During extended spins of two to three turns or more, the spin
will tend to change into a spiral, particularly to the right. This will be
accompanied by an increase in airspeed and gravity loads on the
airplane. If this occurs, recovery should be accomplished promptly but
smoothly by leveling the wings and recovering from the resulting dive.

SECTION 4 CESSNA

NORMAL PROCEDURES MODEL 172S NAV III

#### SPINS (Continued)

Regardless of how many turns the spin is held or how it is entered, the
following recovery technique should be used:

1. VERIFY THAT THROTTLE IS IN IDLE POSITION AND
AILERONS ARE NEUTRAL.
2. APPLY AND **HOLD** FULL RUDDER OPPOSITE TO THE
DIRECTION OF ROTATION.
3. JUST **AFTER** THE RUDDER REACHES THE STOP, MOVE
THE CONTROL WHEEL **BRISKLY** FORWARD FAR ENOUGH
TO BREAK THE STALL.

4. **HOLD** THESE CONTROL INPUTS UNTIL ROTATION STOPS.
5. AS ROTATION STOPS, NEUTRALIZE RUDDER, AND MAKE A
SMOOTH RECOVERY FROM THE RESULTING DIVE.

**NOTE**

If disorientation makes the direction of rotation difficult to
determine, see the turn vector near the index at the top of
the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI).

Variations in basic airplane rigging or in weight and balance due to
installed equipment or right seat occupancy can cause differences in
behavior, particularly in extended spins. These differences are normal
and will result in variations in the spin characteristics and in the
spiraling tendencies for spins of more than 2 turns. However, the
recovery technique should always be used and will result in the most
expeditious recovery from any spin.

Intentional spins with flaps extended are prohibited, since the high
airspeeds which may occur during recovery can be more than the flap
airspeed limitation and can damage the flap and wing structures.

#### **LANDING**
##### **NORMAL LANDING**

Normal landing approaches can be made with power on or power off
with any flap setting within the flap airspeed limits. Surface winds and
air turbulence are usually the primary factors in determining the most
comfortable approach speeds. Steep slips with flap settings greater
than 20° can cause a slight tendency for the elevator to oscillate under
certain combinations of airspeed, sideslip angle, and center of gravity
loadings.

Landing at slower speeds will result in shorter landing distances and
minimum wear to tires and brakes. Power must be at idle as the main
wheels touch the ground. The main wheels must touch the ground
before the nosewheel. The nosewheel must be lowered to the runway
carefully after the speed has diminished to avoid unnecessary nose
gear loads. This procedure is very important for rough or soft field
landings.
##### **SHORT FIELD LANDING**

For a short field landing in smooth air conditions, approach at 61 KIAS
with FULL flaps using enough power to control the glide path. Slightly
higher approach speeds should be used in turbulent air conditions.
After all approach obstacles are cleared, smoothly reduce power and
hold the approach speed by lowering the nose of the airplane. The
main wheels must touch the ground before the nosewheel with power
at idle. Immediately after the main wheels touch the ground, carefully
lower the nosewheel and apply heavy braking as required. For
maximum brake performance, retract the flaps, hold the control wheel
full back, and apply maximum brake pressure without skidding the tires.

#### LANDING (Continued)
##### **CROSSWIND LANDING**

When landing in a strong crosswind, use the minimum flap setting
required for the field length. If flap settings greater than 20° are used in
sideslips with full rudder deflection, some elevator oscillation may be
felt at normal approach speeds. However, this does not affect control of
the airplane. Although the crab or combination method of drift
correction may be used, the wing low method gives the best control.
After touchdown, hold a straight course with the steerable nosewheel,
with aileron deflection as applicable, and occasional braking if
necessary.

The maximum allowable crosswind velocity is dependent upon pilot
capability as well as airplane limitations. Operation in direct crosswinds
of 15 knots has been demonstrated (not an operating limitation).
##### **BALKED LANDING**

In a balked landing (go-around) climb, reduce the flap setting to 20°
immediately after full power is applied and climb at 60 KIAS. If
obstacles must be cleared during the go-around climb, reduce the wing
flap setting to 10° and maintain a safe airspeed until the obstacles are
cleared. Above 3000 feet pressure altitude, lean the mixture to obtain
maximum RPM. After clearing any obstacles, carefully retract the flaps
and allow the airplane to accelerate to normal climb airspeed.

#### **COLD WEATHER OPERATIONS**

Special consideration should be given to the operation of the airplane
fuel system during the winter season or prior to any flight in cold
temperatures. Proper preflight draining of the fuel system is especially
important and will eliminate any free water accumulation. The use of
additives such as isopropyl alcohol or Diethylene Glycol Monomethyl
Ether (DIEGME) may also be desirable. Refer to Section 8 for
information on the proper use of additives.

Cold weather often causes conditions that require special care during
airplane operations. **Even small accumulations of frost, ice, or snow**
**must be removed, particularly from wing, tail and all control**
**surfaces to assure satisfactory flight performance and handling.**
Also, control surfaces must be free of any internal accumulations of ice
or snow.

If snow or slush covers the takeoff surface, allowance must be made for
takeoff distances which will be increasingly extended as the snow or
slush depth increases. The depth and consistency of this cover can, in
fact, prevent takeoff in many instances.

#### COLD WEATHER OPERATION (Continued)
##### **STARTING**

When air temperatures are below 20°F (-6°C), use an external
preheater and an external power source whenever possible to obtain
positive starting and to reduce wear and abuse to the engine and
electrical system. Preheat will thaw the oil trapped in the oil cooler,
which probably will be congealed prior to starting in extremely cold
temperatures.

**WARNING**

**WHEN TURNING THE PROPELLER BY HAND, TREAT IT**
**AS IF THE MAGNETOS SWITCH IS IN THE ON**
**POSITION. A LOOSE OR BROKEN GROUND WIRE ON**
**EITHER MAGNETO COULD ENERGIZE THE ENGINE.**

Prior to starting on cold mornings, it is advisable to turn the propeller
manually through several engine compression cycles by hand to loosen
the oil, so the engine cranks (motors) more easily and uses less battery
power. When the propeller is turned manually, turn it in the opposite
direction to normal engine rotation for greater safety. Opposite rotation
disengages the magneto impulse couplings and prevents possible
unwanted ignition.

When using an external power source, the MASTER switch ALT and
BAT sections must be in the OFF position before connecting the
external power source to the airplane receptacle. Refer to Section 7,
External Power Receptacle, for external power source operations.

#### COLD WEATHER OPERATION (Continued)
##### STARTING (Continued)

Cold weather starting procedures are the same as the normal starting
procedures. However, to conserve battery power the beacon light can
be left off until the engine is started. Use caution to prevent inadvertent
forward movement of the airplane during starting when parked on snow
or ice.

During cold weather starting, when performing the Standby Battery
energy level test, the test lamp may not illuminate and the BUS E volts
may be less than 24 volts before turning on the MASTER (ALT and
BAT) switch. After engine start, verify the S BATT ammeter shows a
charge (positive) at 1000 RPM or greater. Prior to takeoff verify the S
BATT ammeter shows a charge less than 0.4 amps.

**NOTE**

If the engine does not start during the first few attempts, or
if engine firing diminishes in strength, the spark plugs may
be frosted over. Preheat must be used before another start
is attempted.

During cold weather operations, the oil temperature indicator may not
be in the green band prior to takeoff if outside air temperatures are very
cold. After a suitable warm up period (2 to 5 minutes at 1000 RPM),
accelerate the engine several times to higher engine RPMs. If the
engine accelerates smoothly and the oil pressure remains normal and
steady, the airplane is ready for takeoff.
##### **WINTERIZATION KIT**

An optional winterization kit is available and may be utilized when cold
weather operations are conducted. Refer to Section 9, Supplement 4
for installation and operational details.

#### **HOT WEATHER OPERATIONS**

Refer to the general warm temperature starting information under
Starting Engine in this section. Avoid prolonged engine operation on the
ground.
#### **NOISE CHARACTERISTICS**

The certified takeoff noise level for the Model 172S at 2550 pounds
maximum weight is 75.1 dB(A) per 14 CFR 36 Appendix G (through
Amendment 36-21) and 78.2 dB(A) per ICAO Annex 16 Chapter 10
(through Amendment 4). No determination has been made that the
noise levels of this airplane are, or should be, acceptable or
unacceptable for operation at, into, or out of, any airport.

The following procedures are suggested to minimize the effect of
airplane noise on the public:

1. Pilots operating airplanes under VFR over outdoor assemblies
of persons, recreational and park areas, and other noise
sensitive areas should make every effort to fly not less than
2000 feet AGL, weather permitting, even though flight at a lower
level may be consistent with the provisions of government
regulations.

2. During departure from or approach to an airport, climb after
takeoff and descent for landing should be made so as to avoid
prolonged flight at low altitude near noise sensitive areas.

**NOTE**

The above recommended procedures do not apply where
they would conflict with Air Traffic Control clearances or
instructions, or where, in the pilot's judgment, an altitude of
less than 2000 feet AGL is necessary to adequately
exercise the duty to see and avoid other airplanes.

MODEL 172S NAV III PERFORMANCE

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **INTRODUCTION**

Performance data charts on the following pages are presented so that
you may know what to expect from the airplane under various
conditions and to facilitate the planning of flights in detail with
reasonable accuracy. The data in the charts has been computed from
actual flight tests with the airplane and engine in good condition and
using average piloting techniques.

It should be noted that performance information presented in the range
and endurance profile charts allows for 45 minutes reserve fuel at the
specified power setting. Fuel flow data for cruise is based on the
recommended lean mixture setting at all altitudes. Some indeterminate
variables such as mixture leaning technique, fuel metering
characteristics, engine and propeller condition, and air turbulence may
account for variations of 10% or more in range and endurance.
Therefore, it is important to utilize all available information to estimate
the fuel required for the particular flight and to flight plan in a
conservative manner.
#### **USE OF PERFORMANCE CHARTS**

Performance data is presented in tabular or graphical form to illustrate
the effect of different variables. Sufficiently detailed information is
provided in the tables so that conservative values can be selected and
used to determine the particular performance figure with reasonable
accuracy.

#### **SAMPLE PROBLEM**

The following sample flight problem utilizes information from the
various charts to determine the predicted performance data for a typical
flight. Assume the following information has already been determined:

**AIRPLANE CONFIGURATION:**

Takeoff weight 2550 Pounds

Usable fuel 53.0 Gallons

**TAKEOFF CONDITIONS:**

Field pressure altitude 1500 Feet

Temperature 28°C (16°C Above Standard)

Wind component along runway 12 Knot Head Wind

Field length 3500 Feet

**CRUISE CONDITIONS:**

Total distance 360 Nautical Miles

Pressure altitude 7500 Feet

Temperature 16°C (16°C Above Standard)

Expected wind enroute 10 Knot Head Wind

**LANDING CONDITIONS:**

Field pressure altitude 2000 Feet
Temperature 25°C

Field length 3000 Feet

CESSNA SECTION 5

MODEL 172S NAV III PERFORMANCE

GFC 700 AFCS
#### SAMPLE PROBLEM (Continued)
##### **TAKEOFF**

The takeoff distance chart, Figure 5-5, should be consulted, keeping in
mind that distances shown are based on the short field technique.
Conservative distances can be established by reading the chart at the
next higher value of weight, altitude and temperature. For example, in
this particular sample problem, the takeoff distance information
presented for a weight of 2550 pounds, pressure altitude of 2000 feet
and a temperature of 30°C should be used and results in the following:

1285 Feet
Ground roll

Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle 2190 Feet

These distances are well within the available takeoff field length.
However, a correction for the effect of wind may be made based on
information presented in the note section of the takeoff chart. The
correction for a 12 knot head wind is:

12 Knots
X 10% = 13% Decrease

9 Knots

This results in the following distances, corrected for wind:

Ground roll, zero wind 1285 Feet

Decrease in ground roll (1285 feet X 13%) -167 Feet

Corrected ground roll 1118 Feet

Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle, zero wind 2190 Feet

Decrease in total distance (2190 feet X 13%) -285 Feet

Corrected total distance to clear 50-foot obstacle 1905 Feet

SECTION 5 CESSNA

PERFORMANCE MODEL 172S NAV III

GFC 700 AFCS
#### SAMPLE PROBLEM (Continued)
##### **CRUISE**

The cruising altitude should be selected based on a consideration of
trip length, winds aloft and the airplane's performance. A typical
cruising altitude and the expected wind enroute have been given for
this sample problem. However, the power setting selection for cruise
must be determined based on several considerations. These include
the cruise performance characteristics presented in Figure 5-8, the
range profile chart presented in Figure 5-9, and the endurance profile
chart presented in Figure 5-10.

The relationship between power and range is illustrated by the range
profile chart. Considerable fuel savings and longer range result when
lower power settings are used. For this sample problem, a cruise power
of approximately 65% will be used.

The cruise performance chart, Figure 5-8, is entered at 8000 feet
pressure altitude and 20°C above standard temperature. These values
most nearly correspond to the planned altitude and expected
temperature conditions. The engine speed chosen is 2600 RPM, which
results in the following:

Power 64%

True airspeed 117 Knots

Cruise fuel flow 8.9 GPH

MODEL 172S NAV III PERFORMANCE

GFC 700 AFCS
#### SAMPLE PROBLEM (Continued)
##### **FUEL REQUIRED**

The total fuel requirement for the flight may be estimated using the
performance information in Figure 5-7 and Figure 5-8. For this sample
problem, the time, fuel and distance to climb may be determined from
Figure 5-7 for normal climb. The difference between the values shown
in the table for 2000 feet and 8000 feet results in the following:

Time: 11 Minutes

Fuel: 2.2 Gallons

Distance: 15 Nautical Miles

These values are for a standard temperature and are sufficiently
accurate for most flight planning purposes. However, a further
correction for the effect of temperature may be made as noted on the
climb chart. The approximate effect of a nonstandard temperature is to
increase the time, fuel and distance by 10% for each 10°C above
standard temperature, due to the lower rate of climb. In this case,
assuming a temperature 16°C above standard the correction would be:

16°C

X 10% = 16% Increase
10°C

With this factor included, the fuel estimate would be calculated as
follows:

Fuel to climb, standard temperature 2.2 Gallons

Increase due to non-standard temperature (2.2 X 16%) 0.4 Gallons

Corrected fuel to climb 2.6 Gallons

Using a similar procedure for the distance to climb results in 18 nautical
miles.

The resultant cruise distance is:

Total distance 360 Nautical Miles

Climb distance -18 Nautical Miles

Cruise distance 342 Nautical Miles

SECTION 5 CESSNA

PERFORMANCE MODEL 172S NAV III

GFC 700 AFCS
#### SAMPLE PROBLEM (Continued)
##### FUEL REQUIRED (Continued)

With an expected 10 knot head wind, the ground speed for cruise is
predicted to be:

117 Knots

-10 Knots

107 Knots

Therefore, the time required for the cruise portion of the trip is:

342 Nautical Miles = 3.2 Hours

107 Knots

The fuel required for cruise is:

3.2 hours X 8.9 gallons/hour = 28.5 Gallons

A 45-minute reserve requires:

45
X 8.9 gallons/hour = 6.7 Gallons
60

The total estimated fuel required is as follows:

Engine start, taxi, and takeoff 1.4 Gallons

Climb 2.6 Gallons

Cruise 28.5 Gallons

Reserve 6.7 Gallons

Total fuel required 39.2 Gallons

Once the flight is underway, ground speed checks will provide a more
accurate basis for estimating the time enroute and the corresponding
fuel required to complete the trip with ample reserve.

#### SAMPLE PROBLEM (Continued)
##### **LANDING**

A procedure similar to takeoff should be used for estimating the landing
distance at the destination airport. Figure 5-11 presents landing
distance information for the short field technique. The distances
corresponding to 2000 feet and 30°C are as follows:

Ground roll 650 Feet

Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle 1455 Feet

A correction for the effect of wind may be made based on information
presented in the note section of the landing chart, using the same
procedure as outlined for takeoff.
#### **DEMONSTRATED OPERATING TEMPERATURE**

Satisfactory engine cooling has been demonstrated for this airplane
with an outside air temperature 23°C above standard. This is not to be
considered as an operating limitation. Reference should be made to
Section 2 for engine operating limitations.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

This section describes the procedure for establishing the basic empty
weight and moment of the airplane. Sample forms are provided for
reference. Procedures for calculating the weight and moment for
various operations are also provided. For additional information
regarding Weight and Balance procedures, refer to the Aircraft Weight
and Balance Handbook (FAA-H-8083-1). A comprehensive list of
Cessna equipment available for this airplane is included at the back of
this section.

Specific information regarding the weight, arm, moment and installed
equipment for this airplane as delivered from the factory can be found
in the plastic envelope in the back of this POH.

1. Preparation:
a. Inflate tires to recommended operating pressures.
b. Defuel airplane. Refer to the Maintenance Manual.
c. Service engine oil as required to obtain a normal full
indication (approximately 7 quarts on dipstick).
d. Move sliding seats to the most forward position.
e. Raise flaps to the fully retracted position.
f. Place all control surfaces in neutral position.
g. Remove all non-required items from airplane.

WEIGHT AND BALANCE/ MODEL 172S NAV III
EQUIPMENT LIST GFC 700 AFCS
#### AIRPLANE WEIGHING PROCEDURES (Continued)

2. Level:
a. Place scales under each wheel (minimum scale capacity,
1000 pounds).
b. Deflate the nose tire and/or lower or raise the nose strut to
properly center the bubble in the level (Refer to Figure 6-1
Sheet 1).
3. Weigh:
a. Weigh airplane in a closed hangar to avoid errors caused by
air currents.
b. With the airplane level and brakes released, record the
weight shown on each scale. Deduct the tare, if any, from
each reading.
4. Measure:
a. Obtain measurement A by measuring horizontally (along the
airplane centerline) from a line stretched between the main
wheel centers to a plumb bob dropped from the firewall.
b. Obtain measurement B by measuring horizontally and
parallel to the airplane centerline, from center of nosewheel
axle, left side, to a plumb bob dropped from the line between
the main wheel centers. Repeat on right side and average
the measurements.
5. Using weights from step 3 and measurements from step 4, the
Basic Empty Weight and C.G. can be determined by completing
Figure 6-1 (Sheet 2).
6. Changes to the Airplane Weight and Balance due to alteration or
repair must be documented in a permanent record within the
POH similar to that shown in Figure 6-2.
7. A new Basic Empty Weight and CG Arm based on actual airplane
weight (as weighed) is required after a major repair or alteration.
It is recommended that the airplane be weighed to verify Basic
Empty Weight and CG Arm at intervals not to exceed 5 years.

#### **WEIGHT AND BALANCE**

The following information will enable you to operate your Cessna within
the prescribed weight and center of gravity limitations. To determine
weight and balance, use the Sample Loading Problem (Figure 6-3),
Loading Graph (Figure 6-4), and Center of Gravity Moment Envelope
(Figure 6-7) as follows:

Enter the appropriate basic empty weight and moment/1000 from the
weight and balance records for your airplane in the YOUR AIRPLANE
column of the Sample Loading Problem.

**NOTE**

In addition to the basic empty weight and moment noted on
these records, the C.G. arm (FS) is also shown, but need
not be used on the Sample Loading Problem. The moment
which is shown must be divided by 1000 and this value
used as the moment/1000 on the loading problem.

Use the Loading Graph to determine the moment/1000 for each
additional item to be carried; then list these on the loading problem.

**NOTE**

Loading Graph information for the pilot, passengers and
baggage is based on seats positioned for average
occupants and baggage loaded in the center of the
baggage areas as shown on the Loading Arrangements
diagram. For loadings which may differ from these, the
Sample Loading Problem lists fuselage stations (FS) for
these items to indicate their forward and aft C.G. range
limitations (seat travel and baggage area limitation). Refer
to Figures 6-5 and 6-6 for additional loading information.
Additional moment calculations, based on the actual weight
and C.G. arm (FS) of the item being loaded, must be made
if the position of the load is different from that shown on the
Loading Graph.

Total the weights and moments/1000 and plot these values on the
Center of Gravity Moment Envelope to determine whether the point
falls within the envelope, and if the loading is acceptable.

##### **BAGGAGE TIEDOWN**

A nylon baggage net having four tiedown straps is provided as
standard equipment to secure baggage on the cabin floor aft of the rear
seat (baggage area A) and in the aft baggage area (baggage area B).
Six eyebolts serve as attaching points for the net. Two eyebolts for the
forward tiedown straps are mounted on the cabin floor near each
sidewall just forward of the baggage door approximately at station FS
90; two eyebolts are installed on the cabin floor slightly inboard of each
sidewall approximately at FS 107; and two eyebolts are located below
the aft window near each sidewall approximately at FS 107. A placard
on the baggage door defines the weight limitations in the baggage
areas.

When baggage area A is utilized for baggage only, the two forward floor
mounted eyebolts and the two aft floor mounted eyebolts (or the two
eyebolts below the aft window) may be used, depending on the height
of the baggage. When baggage is carried in the baggage area B only,
the aft floor mounted eyebolts and the eyebolts below the aft window
should be used. When baggage is loaded in both areas, all six eyebolts
should be utilized.

#### **COMPREHENSIVE EQUIPMENT LIST**

Figure 6-9 is a comprehensive list of all Cessna equipment which is available for
the Model 172S airplane equipped with Garmin G1000 Integrated Cockpit System
and GFC 700 Autopilot (if installed) (Serials 172S10468, 172S10507, 172S10640
and 172S10656 and On). This comprehensive equipment list provides the following
information in column form:

In the **ITEM NO** column, each item is assigned a coded number. The first two
digits of the code represent the identification of the item within Air Transport
Association Specification 100 (11 for Paint and Placards; 24 for Electrical
Power; 77 for Engine Indicating, etc.). These assignments also correspond to
the Maintenance Manual chapter for the airplane. After the first two digits, items
receive a unique sequence number (01, 02, 03, etc.). After the sequence
number, a suffix letter is assigned to identify equipment as a required item, a
standard item or an optional item.

Suffix letters are as follows:

R = Required items or equipment for FAA certification (14 CFR 23 or 14
CFR 91).

S = Standard equipment items.

O = Optional equipment items replacing required or standard items.

A = Optional equipment items which are in addition to required or
standard items.

In the **EQUIPMENT LIST DESCRIPTION** column, each item is assigned a
descriptive name to help identify its function.

In the **REF DRAWING** column, a Cessna drawing number is provided which
corresponds to the item.

**NOTE**

If additional equipment is to be installed, it must be done in
accordance with the reference drawing, service bulletin or a separate
FAA approval.
In the **WT LBS** and **ARM INS** columns, information is provided on the weight (in
pounds) and arm (in inches) of the equipment item.

**NOTE**
### • Unless otherwise indicated, true values (not net change values)

for the weight and arm are shown. Positive arms are distances aft
of the airplane datum; negative arms are distances forward of the
datum.
### • Asterisks (*) in the weight and arm column indicate complete

assembly installations. Some major components of the assembly
are listed on the lines immediately following. The sum of these
major components does not necessarily equal the complete
assembly installation.

depressed, a spring loaded steering bungee, which is connected to the
nose gear and to the rudder bars, will turn the nosewheel through an
arc of approximately 10° each side of center. By applying either left or
right brake, the degree of turn may be increased up to 30° each side of
center.

Moving the airplane by hand is most easily accomplished by attaching
a towbar to the nose gear strut. If a towbar is not available, or pushing
is required, use the wing struts as push points. Do not use the vertical
or horizontal surfaces to move the airplane. If the airplane is to be
towed by vehicle, never turn the nosewheel more than 30° either side
of center or structural damage to the nose gear could result.

The minimum turning radius of the airplane, using differential braking
and nosewheel steering during taxi, is approximately 27 feet. To obtain
a minimum radius turn during ground handling, the airplane may be
rotated around either main landing gear by pressing down on a tailcone
bulkhead just forward of the horizontal stabilizer to raise the nosewheel
off the ground. Care should be exercised to ensure that pressure is
exerted only on the bulkhead area and not on skin between the
bulkheads. Pressing down on the horizontal stabilizer to raise the
nosewheel off the ground is not recommended.

#### **SEATS**

The seating arrangement consists of two vertically adjusting crew seats
for the pilot and front seat passenger, and a single bench seat with
adjustable back for rear seat passengers.

Seats used for the pilot and front seat passenger are adjustable
forward and aft, and up and down. Additionally, the angle of the seat
back is infinitely adjustable.

Forward and aft adjustment is made using the handle located below the
center of the seat frame. To position the seat, lift the handle, slide the
seat into position, release the handle and check that the seat is locked
in place. To adjust the height of the seat, rotate the large crank under
the right corner of the seat until a comfortable height is obtained. To
adjust the seat back angle, pull up on the release button, located in
center front of seat, just under the seat bottom, position the seat back
to the desired angle, and release the button. When the seat is not
occupied, the seat back will automatically fold forward whenever the
release button is pulled up.

The rear passenger seat consists of a fixed, one piece seat bottom and
a three-position reclining back. The reclining back is adjusted by a lever
located below the center of the seat frame. To adjust the seat back,
raise the lever, position the seat back to the desired angle, release the
lever, and check that the seat back is securely locked in place.

Headrests are installed on both the front and rear seats. To adjust the
headrest, apply enough pressure to it to raise or lower it to the desired
level.

#### **INTEGRATED SEAT BELT/SHOULDER HARNESS**

All seat positions are equipped with integrated seat belts/shoulder
harness assemblies, Refer to Figure 7-4. The design incorporates an
overhead inertia reel for the shoulder portion, and a retractor assembly
for the lap portion of the belt. This design allows for complete freedom
of movement of the upper torso area while providing restraint in the lap
belt area. In the event of a sudden deceleration, reels lock up to provide
positive restraint for the user.

In the front seats, the inertia reels are located on the centerline of the
upper cabin area. In the rear seats, the inertia reels are located
outboard of each passenger in the upper cabin.

To use the integrated seat belt/shoulder harness, grasp the link with
one hand, and, in a single motion, extend the assembly and insert into
the buckle. Positive locking has occurred when a distinctive “snap”
sound is heard.

Proper locking of the lap belt can be verified by ensuring that the belts
are allowed to retract into the retractors and the lap belt is snug and low
on the waist as worn normally during flight. No more than one
additional inch of belt should be able to be pulled out of the retractor
once the lap belt is in place on the occupant. If more than one
additional inch of belt can be pulled out of the retractor, the occupant is
too small for the installed restraint system and the seat should not be
occupied until the occupant is properly restrained.

Removal is accomplished by pressing the release button on the buckle
and pulling out and up on the harness. Spring tension on the inertia reel
will automatically stow the harness.

#### **ENTRANCE DOORS AND CABIN WINDOWS**

Entry to and exit from the airplane is accomplished through either of
two entry doors, one on each side of the cabin, at the front seat
positions, Refer to Section 6 for cabin and cabin door dimensions. The
doors incorporate a recessed exterior door handle, a conventional
interior door handle, a key operated door lock, left door only, a door
stop mechanism, and openable windows in both the left and right
doors.

**NOTE**

The door latch design on this model requires that the
outside door handle on the pilot and front passenger doors
be extended out whenever the doors are open. When
closing the door, do not attempt to push the door handle in
until the door is fully shut.

To open the doors from outside the airplane, utilize the recessed door
handle near the aft edge of either door by grasping the forward edge of
the handle and pulling outboard. To close or open the doors from inside
the airplane, use the combination door handle and arm rest. The inside
door handle has three positions and a placard at its base which reads
OPEN, CLOSE, and LOCK. The handle is spring loaded to the CLOSE
(up) position. When the door has been pulled shut and latched, lock it
by rotating the door handle forward to the LOCK position (flush with the
arm rest). When the handle is rotated to the LOCK position, an over
center action will hold it in that position. Both cabin doors should be
locked prior to flight, and should not be opened intentionally during
flight.

**NOTE**

Accidental opening of a cabin door in flight, due to improper
closing, does not constitute a need to land the airplane. The
best procedure is to set up the airplane in a trimmed
condition at approximately 75 KIAS, momentarily shove the
door outward slightly, and forcefully close and lock the door.

#### **ENTRANCE DOORS AND CABIN WINDOWS**

(Continued)

Exit from the airplane is accomplished by rotating the door handle from
the LOCK position, past the CLOSE position, aft to the OPEN position
and pushing the door open. To lock the airplane, lock the right cabin
door with the inside handle, close the left cabin door, and using the
ignition key, lock the door.

The left and right cabin doors are equipped with openable windows
which are held in the closed position by a detent equipped latch on the
lower edge of the window frame. To open the windows, rotate the latch
upward. Each window is equipped with a spring-loaded retaining arm
which will help rotate the window outward, and hold it there. If required,
either window may be opened at any speed up to 163 KIAS. The rear
side windows and rear windows are of the fixed type and cannot be
opened.
#### **CONTROL LOCKS**

A control lock is provided to lock the aileron and elevator control
surfaces to prevent damage to these systems by wind buffeting while
the airplane is parked. The lock consists of a shaped steel rod and flag.
The flag identifies the control lock and cautions about its removal
before starting the engine. To install the control lock, align the hole in
the top of the pilot’s control wheel shaft with the hole in the top of the
shaft collar on the instrument panel and insert the rod into the aligned
holes. Installation of the lock will secure the ailerons in a neutral
position and the elevators in a slightly trailing edge down position.
Proper installation of the lock will place the flag over the ignition switch.
In areas where high or gusty winds occur, a control surface lock should
be installed over the vertical stabilizer and rudder. The control lock and
any other type of locking device should be removed prior to starting the
engine.

#### **ENGINE**

The airplane is powered by a direct drive, horizontally opposed, four
cylinder, overhead valve, air cooled, fuel injected engine with a wet
sump lubrication system. The engine is a Lycoming Model IO-360-L2A
rated at 180 horsepower at 2700 RPM. Major accessories include a
starter and belt driven alternator mounted on the front of the engine,
dual magnetos, vacuum pump, engine driven fuel pump, and a full flow
oil filter mounted on the rear of the engine accessory case.
##### **ENGINE CONTROLS**

Engine power is set using the throttle control. The throttle control is a
smooth black knob located at the center of the instrument panel below
the standby instruments. The throttle control is configured so that the
throttle is open in the forward position and closed in the full aft position.
A friction lock, located at the base of the throttle, is operated by rotating
the lock clockwise to increase friction or counterclockwise to decrease
friction.

Engine fuel mixture is controlled by the mixture control. The mixture
control is a red knob, with raised points around the circumference,
located immediately to the right of the throttle control and is equipped
with a lock button in the end of the knob. The rich position is full
forward, and full aft is the idle cutoff position. For small adjustments, the
control may be moved forward by rotating the knob clockwise, and aft
by rotating the knob counterclockwise. For rapid or large adjustments,
the knob may be moved forward or aft by depressing the lock button in
the end of the control, and then positioning the control as desired.

#### ENGINE (Continued)
##### **ENGINE INSTRUMENTS**

The G1000 Engine Indication System (EIS) provides graphical
indicators and numeric values for engine, fuel, and electrical system
parameters to the pilot. The EIS is shown in a vertical strip on the left
side of the PFD during engine starts and on the MFD during normal
operation. If either the MFD or PFD fails during flight, the EIS is shown
on the remaining display.

The EIS consists of three pages that are selected using the ENGINE
softkey. The ENGINE page provides indicators for Tachometer (RPM),
Fuel Flow (FFLOW GPH), Oil Pressure (OIL PRES), Oil Temperature
(OIL TEMP), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), Vacuum (VAC), Fuel
Quantity (FUEL QTY GAL), Engine Hours (ENG HRS), Electrical Bus
Voltages (VOLTS), and Battery Currents (AMPS). When the ENGINE
softkey is pressed, the LEAN and SYSTEM softkeys appear adjacent to
the ENGINE softkey. The LEAN page provides simultaneous indicators
for Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT °F) and Cylinder Head
Temperature (CHT °F) on all cylinders to be used for adjusting, or
leaning, the fuel/air mixture along with a digital value for FFLOW GPH
and a indicator for FUEL QTY GAL. The SYSTEM page provides
numerical values for parameters on the ENGINE page that are shown
as indicators only. The SYSTEM page also provides a digital value for
Fuel Used (GAL USED) and Fuel Remaining (GAL REM).

The engine and airframe unit, located forward of the instrument panel,
receives signals from the engine/system sensors for the parameters
that are being monitored. The engine and airframe unit provides data to
the EIS, which displays the data for the ENGINE page described on the
following pages.

**RPM (TACHOMETER)**

Engine speed (RPM) is shown by the tachometer indicator found on all
EIS pages. The tachometer indicator uses a circular scale with moving
pointer and a digital value. The pointer moves through a range from 0
to 3000 RPM. The numerical RPM value is displayed in increments of
10 RPM in white numerals below the pointer.

The normal engine speed operating limit (top of green arc) changes
with altitude. For standard-day conditions, between sea level and 5000
feet, 2500 RPM is the upper limit of the normal operating range. From
5000 feet to 10,000 feet, 2600 RPM is the top of the normal range. And
above 10,000 feet, 2700 RPM is the upper limit of the normal operating
range.

When engine speed is 2780 RPM or more, the pointer, digital value,
and label (RPM) turn red to show engine speed is more than the limit.
The digital value and label (RPM) will flash. The engine speed
(tachometer) is displayed in the same configuration and location on the
LEAN and SYSTEM pages. If engine speed becomes 2780 RPM or
more, while on the LEAN or SYSTEM page, the display will return to
the ENGINE page.

A speed sensor, mounted on the engine tachometer drive accessory
pad, provides a digital signal to the engine and airframe unit which
processes and outputs the RPM data to the EIS. A red X through the
RPM indicator shows the indicating system is inoperative.

**FUEL FLOW**

Fuel flow is shown on the ENGINE page by the FFLOW GPH horizontal
indicator. The indicator range is from 0 to 20 gallons per hour (GPH)
with 2 GPH graduations, with a green band from 0 to 12 GPH. A white
pointer shows the measured fuel flow.

A digital value for FFLOW GPH is included on both the EIS LEAN and
SYSTEM pages.

The fuel flow transducer is located in the engine fuel injection system
between the fuel/air control unit (servo) and the fuel distribution
manifold (flow divider). The transducer provides a signal to the engine
display that is processed and shown as fuel flow (FFLOW) on the EIS
pages. A red X through the indicator means the indicating system is
inoperative.

**OIL PRESSURE**

Engine oil pressure is shown on the ENGINE page by the OIL PRES
horizontal indicator. The indicator range is 0 to 120 PSI with a red band
from 0 to 20 PSI, a green band from 50 to 90 PSI (normal operating
range) and a red band from 115 to 120 PSI. A white pointer indicates
actual oil pressure. Oil pressure is shown numerically on the SYSTEM
page.

When oil pressure is 0 to 20 PSI or 115 to 120 PSI, the pointer, digital
value, and label (OIL PRES) will change to red to show that oil pressure
is outside normal limits. If oil pressure exceeds either the upper or
lower limit while on the LEAN or SYSTEM page, the EIS will return to
the ENGINE page.

When the engine speed (RPM) is in the green arc and the oil
temperature is in the green band, the oil pressure should be in the
green band. If oil pressure is below the green band or above the green
band, adjust the engine speed to maintain adequate oil pressure. When
engine speed is at idle or near idle, the oil pressure indication must be
above the lower red band. With the engine at normal operating oil
temperature, and engine speed at or close to idle, oil pressure below
the green band, but above the lower red band, is acceptable.

**OIL PRESSURE** (Continued)

In cold weather, the oil pressure will initially be high (close to the upper
red band when the engine is started). As the engine and oil warm up,
the oil pressure will come down into the green band range.

The oil pressure transducer, connected to the engine forward oil
pressure port, provides a signal to the engine display that is processed
and shown as oil pressure. A separate low oil pressure switch causes
an OIL PRESSURE annunciation on the PFD when oil pressure is 0 to
20 PSI. A red X through the oil pressure indicator means that the
indicating system is inoperative.

**OIL TEMPERATURE**

Engine oil temperature is shown on the ENGINE page by the OIL
TEMP horizontal indicator. The indicator range is from 75°F to 250°F
with a green band (normal operating range) from 100°F to 245°F and a
red band from 245°F to 250°F. A white pointer indicates actual oil
temperature. Oil temperature is displayed numerically on the SYSTEM
page.

When oil temperature is in the red band, 245°F to 250°F, the pointer
and OIL TEMP turn red and flash to show oil temperature is higher than
the limit. If oil temperature becomes hotter than 245°F while on the
LEAN or SYSTEM page, the display will default to the ENGINE page.

The oil temperature sensor is installed in the engine oil filter adapter
and provides a signal to the engine display that is processed and
shown as oil temperature. A red X through the indicator shows that the
indicating system is inoperative.

**CYLINDER HEAD TEMPERATURE**

Cylinder head temperature (CHT) for all four cylinders are shown on
the LEAN page. The cylinder with the hottest CHT is indicated by a
cyan bar graph. The indicator range is from 100°F to 500°F with a
normal operating range from 200°F to 500°F and a warning range (red
line) at 500°F. When the CHT is 500°F or hotter, the bar segments,
CHT label and °F digital value will change to red to show that the CHT
is greater than the limit.

A thermocouple is installed in each cylinder head and provides a signal
to the engine display that is processed and shown as CHT on the EIS
LEAN page. The LEAN page will show a red X over any cylinder that
has a probe or wiring failure.

**EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURE**

Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is shown on the ENGINE page by the
EGT horizontal indicator. The indicator range is from 1250°F to 1650°F
with graduations every 50°F. The white pointer indicates relative EGT
with the number of the hottest cylinder displayed inside the pointer. If a
cylinder EGT probe or wiring failure occurs for the hottest EGT, the next
hottest EGT will be displayed.

The EGT for all four cylinders is shown on the LEAN page of the EIS.
The hottest cylinder is indicated by the cyan bar graph. The EGT for a
particular cylinder may be shown by using the CYL SLCT softkey to
select the desired cylinder. Automatic indication of the hottest cylinder
will resume a short time after the CYL SLCT is last selected. The LEAN
page will show a red X over a cylinder that has a probe or wiring failure.

A thermocouple is installed in the exhaust pipe of each cylinder which
measures EGT and provides a signal to the engine display that is
processed and shown as EGT on the EIS LEAN page.

#### ENGINE (Continued)
##### **NEW ENGINE BREAK-IN AND OPERATION**

The engine run-in was accomplished at the factory and is ready for the
full range of use. It is suggested that cruising be accomplished at 75%
power as much as practicable until a total of 50 hours has accumulated
or oil consumption has stabilized. This will ensure proper seating of the
piston rings.
##### **ENGINE LUBRICATION SYSTEM**

The engine utilizes a full pressure, wet sump type lubrication system
with aviation grade oil as the lubricant. The capacity of the engine
sump, located on the bottom of the engine, is eight quarts with one
additional quart contained in the engine oil filter. Oil is drawn from the
sump through a filter screen on the end of a pickup tube to the engine
driven oil pump. Oil from the pump passes through a full-flow oil filter, a
pressure relief valve at the rear of the right oil gallery, and a
thermostatically controlled remote oil cooler. Oil from the remote cooler
is then circulated to the left oil gallery. The engine parts are then
lubricated by oil from the galleries. After lubricating the engine, the oil
returns to the sump by gravity. The filter adapter in the full-flow filter is
equipped with a bypass valve which will cause lubricating oil to bypass
the filter in the event the filter becomes plugged, or the oil temperature
is extremely cold.

An oil dipstick/filler tube is located at the right rear of the engine case.
The oil dipstick/filler tube is accessed through a door located on the
right side of the engine cowling. The engine should not be operated on
less than five quarts of oil. To minimize loss of oil through the breather,
fill to eight quarts for normal flights of less than three hours. For
extended flight, fill to eight quarts (dipstick indication only). For engine
oil grade and specifications, refer to Section 8 of this POH.

#### ENGINE (Continued)
##### **IGNITION AND STARTER SYSTEM **

Engine ignition is provided by two engine driven magnetos, and two
spark plugs in each cylinder. The left magneto fires the upper left and
lower right spark plugs, and the right magneto fires the lower left and
upper right spark plugs. Normal operation is conducted with both
magnetos due to the more complete burning of the fuel/air mixture with
dual ignition.

Ignition and starter operation is controlled by a rotary-type switch
located on the left switch and control panel. The MAGNETOS switch is
labeled clockwise, OFF, R, L, BOTH, and START. The engine should
be operated on both magnetos (BOTH position) except for magneto
checks. The R and L positions are for checking purposes and
emergency use only. When the MAGNETOS switch is rotated to the
spring-loaded START position, with the MASTER switch in the ON
position, the starter contactor is closed and the starter, now energized,
will crank the engine. When the switch is released, it will automatically
return to the BOTH position.
##### **AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM**

The engine air induction system receives ram air through an intake on
the lower front portion of the engine cowling. The intake is covered by
an air filter which removes dust and other foreign matter from the
induction air. Airflow passing through the filter enters an air box, which
is equipped with a spring-loaded alternate air door. If the air induction
filter should become blocked, suction created by the engine will open
the door and draw unfiltered air from inside the lower cowl area. An
open alternate air door will result in an approximate 10% power loss at
full throttle. After passing through the air box, induction air enters a fuel/
air control unit under the engine, and is then ducted to the engine
cylinders through intake manifold tubes.

#### ENGINE (Continued)
##### **EXHAUST SYSTEM**

Exhaust gas from each cylinder passes through a riser assembly to a
common muffler, located below the engine, and then overboard through
a single tailpipe. Outside air is supplied to a shroud constructed around
the outside of the muffler to form a heating chamber. The air heated by
the shroud is then supplied to the cabin.
##### **FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM**

The engine is equipped with a fuel injection system. The system is
comprised of an engine driven fuel pump, fuel/air control unit, fuel
manifold, fuel flow indicator, and air-bleed type injector nozzles.

Fuel is delivered by the engine driven fuel pump to the fuel/air control
unit. The fuel/air control unit correctly proportions the fuel flow to the
induction air flow. After passing through the control unit, induction air is
delivered to the cylinders through the intake manifold tubes and
metered fuel is delivered to a fuel manifold (flow divider). The fuel
manifold, through spring tension on a diaphragm and valve, evenly
distributes the fuel to an air-bleed type injector nozzle in the intake
valve chamber of each cylinder. A turbine-type fuel flow transducer
mounted between the fuel/air control unit and the fuel distribution unit
produces a digital signal that displays fuel flow on the EIS pages.
##### **COOLING SYSTEM**

Ram air for engine cooling enters through two intake openings in the
front of the engine cowling. The cooling air is directed from above the
engine, around the cylinders and other areas of the engine by baffling,
and then exits through an opening at the bottom aft edge of the engine
cowling.

A winterization kit is available for the airplane. Refer to Section 9,
Supplement 4 for description and operating information.
#### **PROPELLER**

The airplane is equipped with a two bladed, fixed pitch, one-piece
forged aluminum alloy propeller which is anodized to retard corrosion.
The propeller is 76 inches in diameter.

#### FUEL SYSTEM (Continued)
##### **FUEL DISTRIBUTION**

Fuel flows by gravity from the two wing tanks to a three-position fuel
selector valve, labeled BOTH, RIGHT and LEFT, and on to the fuel
reservoir tank. From the fuel reservoir tank, fuel flows through the
electrically-driven auxiliary fuel pump, through the fuel shutoff valve,
the fuel strainer, and to the engine-driven fuel pump. From the enginedriven fuel pump, fuel is delivered to the fuel/air control unit on the
bottom of the engine. The fuel/air control unit (fuel servo) meters fuel
flow in proportion to induction air flow. After passing through the control
unit, metered fuel goes to a fuel distribution valve (flow divider) located
on the top of the engine. From the fuel distribution valve, individual fuel
lines are routed to air bleed type injector nozzles located in the intake
chamber of each cylinder.
##### **FUEL INDICATING SYSTEM**

Fuel quantity is measured by two fuel quantity sensors, one in each fuel
tank, and is displayed on the EIS pages. The indicators are marked in
gallons of fuel (GAL). An empty tank is displayed on the fuel quantity
indicator (FUEL QTY GAL) as a red line on the far left of the indicator
scale, and the number 0. When an indicator shows an empty tank,
approximately 1.5 gallons of unusable fuel remain in the tank. The
indicators should not be relied upon for accurate readings during skids,
slips or unusual attitudes.

The fuel quantity indicator shows the fuel available in the tank up to the
limit of the sensor measurement range. At this level, additional fuel may
be added to completely fill the tank, but no additional movement of the
indicator will result. The limit for sensor measurement range is
approximately 24 gallons and is indicated by the maximum limit of the
green band. When the fuel level decreases below the maximum limit of
the fuel sensor, the fuel quantity indicator will display fuel quantity
measured in each tank. A visual check of each wing tank fuel level
must be performed prior to each flight. Compare the visual fuel level

#### FUEL SYSTEM (Continued)
##### FUEL INDICATING SYSTEM (Continued)

The fuel quantity indicators detect low fuel conditions and incorrect
sensor outputs. When fuel quantity is less than 5 gallons indicated (and
remains less than this level for more than 60 seconds), LOW FUEL L
(left) and/or LOW FUEL R (right) will be displayed in amber on the PFD
and a tone will sound. The fuel quantity indicator pointer(s) and
indicator label will change from white to steady amber. When fuel
quantity reaches the calibrated usable fuel empty level, the LOW FUEL
L and/or LOW FUEL R remain amber and the indicator pointer(s) and
label change to flashing red.

**NOTE**

Takeoff is not recommended if both fuel quantity indicator
pointers are in the yellow band range and/or amber LOW
FUEL L or LOW FUEL R annunciator is displayed on the
PFD.

In addition to low fuel annunciation, the warning logic is designed to
report failures with each sensor. If the system detects a failure, the
affected fuel indicator will display a red X. A red X through the top part
of the indicator indicates a failure associated with the left fuel tank. A
red X through the bottom part of the indicator indicates a failure
associated with the right fuel tank.

Fuel flow is measured by use of a turbine type transducer mounted on
top of the engine between the fuel/air control unit and the fuel
distribution unit. This flow meter produces a signal that is displayed as
the rate of fuel flow on the FFLOW GPH indicator on the EIS pages.
FFLOW GPH is shown as either a horizontal analog indicator or a
digital value, depending on the active EIS page.

##### FUEL SYSTEM (Continued) **FUEL CALCULATIONS**

**NOTE**

Fuel calculations do not use the airplane’s fuel quantity
indicators and are calculated from the last time the fuel was
reset.

For fuel consumption information, a fuel used totalizer function is
provided on the EIS SYSTEM page as GAL USED. This digital
indicator shows total fuel used since last reset of the totalizer. To reset
the GAL USED, the EIS SYSTEM page must be active and the RST
USED softkey must be selected. GAL USED is calculated after reset
using information from the fuel flow transducer signal.

For fuel remaining information, a count down fuel totalizer function is
provided on the EIS SYSTEM page as GAL REM. This digital indicator
shows calculated fuel remaining since last GAL REM pilot adjustment.
To adjust GAL REM, the EIS SYSTEM page must be active and the
GAL REM softkey must be selected followed by the appropriate
quantity adjustment softkeys. Refer to the Garmin G1000 CRG for
details for resetting and adjusting fuel calculations. GAL REM is
calculated after pilot adjustment using information from the fuel flow
transducer signal.

**NOTE**

GAL USED and GAL REM provide no indication of the
actual amount of fuel remaining in each tank and should
only be used in conjunction with other fuel management
procedures to estimate total fuel remaining.

#### FUEL SYSTEM (Continued)
##### **AUXILIARY FUEL PUMP OPERATION**

The auxiliary fuel pump is used primarily for priming the engine before
starting. Priming is accomplished through the fuel injection system. The
engine may be flooded if the auxiliary FUEL PUMP switch is
accidentally placed in the ON position for prolonged periods, with
MASTER Switch ON and mixture rich, with the engine stopped.

The auxiliary fuel pump is also used for vapor suppression in hot
weather. Normally, momentary use will be sufficient for vapor
suppression; however, continuous operation is permissible if required.
Turning on the auxiliary fuel pump with a normally operating enginedriven fuel pump will result in only a very minor enrichment of the
mixture.

It is not necessary to operate the auxiliary fuel pump during normal
takeoff and landing, since gravity and the engine-driven fuel pump will
supply adequate fuel flow. In the event of failure of the engine-driven
fuel pump, use of the auxiliary fuel pump will provide sufficient fuel to
maintain flight at maximum continuous power.

Under hot day, high altitude conditions, or conditions during a climb that
are conducive to fuel vapor formation, it may be necessary to utilize the
auxiliary fuel pump to attain or stabilize the fuel flow required for the
type of climb being performed. In this case, turn the auxiliary fuel pump
on, and adjust the mixture to the desired fuel flow. If fluctuating fuel flow
(greater than 1 GPH) is observed during climb or cruise at high
altitudes on hot days, place the auxiliary fuel pump switch in the ON
position to clear the fuel system of vapor. The auxiliary fuel pump may
be operated continuously in cruise.

#### FUEL SYSTEM (Continued)
##### **FUEL RETURN SYSTEM**

A fuel return system was incorporated to improve engine operation
during extended idle operation in hot weather environments. The major
components of the system include an orifice fitting located in the top of
the fuel-air control unit (fuel servo), fuel return line, with check valve,
and a fuel reservoir tank. The fuel return system is designed to return a
metered amount of fuel/vapor back to the fuel reservoir tank. The
increased fuel flow, due to the fuel return system, results in lower fuel
operating temperatures at the engine inlet, which minimizes the amount
of fuel vapor generated in the fuel lines during hot weather operations.
Refer to Section 4 for Hot Weather operating information.
##### **FUEL VENTING**

Fuel system venting is essential to system operation. Complete
blockage of the fuel venting system will result in decreasing fuel flow
and eventual engine stoppage. The fuel venting system consists of an
interconnecting vent line between the fuel tanks and a check valve
equipped overboard vent in the left fuel tank assembly. The overboard
vent protrudes from the bottom surface of the left wing, just inboard of
the wing strut upper attachment point. The fuel filler caps are vacuum
vented; the fuel filler cap vents will open and allow air to enter the fuel
tanks in case the overboard vents become blocked.
##### **REDUCED TANK CAPACITY**

The airplane may be serviced to a reduced capacity to permit heavier
cabin loadings. This is accomplished by filling each tank to the bottom
edge of the fuel filler indicator tab, thus giving a reduced fuel load of
17.5 gallons usable in each tank.

#### FUEL SYSTEM (Continued)
##### **FUEL SELECTOR VALVE**

The fuel selector is a three-position selector valve, labeled BOTH,
RIGHT and LEFT. The fuel selector valve should be in the BOTH
position for takeoff, climb, landing, and maneuvers that involve
prolonged slips or skids of more than 30 seconds. Operation on either
LEFT or RIGHT fuel tank is reserved for level cruising flight only.

**NOTE**
### • When the fuel selector valve is placed in the BOTH

position, while in cruise flight, unequal fuel flow from
each tank may occur if the wings are not maintained
exactly level. Unequal fuel flow can be detected by one
fuel tank indicating more fuel than the other on the L
FUEL and R FUEL indicators. The resulting fuel
imbalance can be corrected by turning the fuel selector
valve to the fuel tank indicating the highest fuel quantity.
Once the L FUEL and R FUEL indicators have
equalized, position the fuel selector valve to the BOTH
position.
### • It is not practical to measure the time required to

consume all of the fuel in one tank, and, after switching
to the opposite tank, expect an equal duration from the
remaining fuel. The airspace in both fuel tanks is
interconnected by a vent line and, therefore, some
sloshing of fuel between tanks can be expected when
the tanks are nearly full and the wings are not level.
### • When the fuel tanks are 1/4 tank or less, prolonged

uncoordinated flight, such as slips or skids, can uncover
the fuel tank outlets causing fuel starvation and engine
stoppage. Therefore, if operating with one fuel tank dry
or operating on either LEFT or RIGHT tank with 1/4 tank
or less, do not allow the airplane to remain in
uncoordinated flight for periods in excess of 30 seconds.

#### FUEL SYSTEM (Continued)
##### **FUEL DRAIN VALVES**

The fuel system is equipped with drain valves to provide a means for
the examination of fuel in the system for contamination and grade. The
system should be examined before each flight and after each refueling,
by using the sampler cup provided to drain fuel from each wing tank
sump, the fuel reservoir tank sump, the fuel selector valve drain and the
fuel strainer sump. If any evidence of fuel contamination is found, it
must be eliminated in accordance with the preflight inspection checklist
and the discussion in Section 8. If takeoff weight limitations for the next
flight permit, the fuel tanks should be filled after each flight to prevent
condensation.
#### **BRAKE SYSTEM**

The airplane has a single-disc, hydraulically-actuated brake on each
main landing gear wheel. Each brake is connected, by a hydraulic line,
to a master cylinder attached to each of the pilot's rudder pedals. The
brakes are operated by applying pressure to the top of either the left
(pilot's) or right (copilot's) set of rudder pedals, which are
interconnected. When the airplane is parked, both main wheel brakes
may be set by utilizing the parking brake which is operated by a handle
under the left side of the instrument panel. To apply the parking brake,
set the brakes with the rudder pedals, pull the handle aft, and rotate it
90° down.

For maximum brake life, keep the brake system properly maintained,
and minimize brake usage during taxi operations and landings.

Some of the symptoms of impending brake failure are: gradual
decrease in braking action after brake application, noisy or dragging
brakes, soft or spongy pedals, and excessive travel and weak braking
action. If any of these symptoms appear, the brake system is in need of
immediate attention. If, during taxi or landing roll, braking action
decreases, let up on the pedals and then reapply the brakes with heavy
pressure. If the brakes become spongy or pedal travel increases,
pumping the pedals should build braking pressure. If one brake
becomes weak or fails, use the other brake sparingly while using
opposite rudder, as required, to offset the good brake

MODEL 172S NAV III AIRPLANE AND SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **ELECTRICAL SYSTEM**

The airplane is equipped with a 28-volt direct current (DC) electrical
system, Refer to Figure 7-7. A belt-driven 60 ampere alternator powers
the system. A 24-volt main storage battery is located inside the engine
cowling on the left firewall. The alternator and main battery are
controlled through the MASTER switch found near the top of the pilot's
switch panel.

Power is supplied to most electrical circuits through two primary buses
(ELECTRICAL BUS 1 and ELECTRICAL BUS 2), with an essential bus
and a crossfeed bus connected between the two primary buses to
support essential equipment.

The system is equipped with a secondary or standby battery located
between the firewall and the instrument panel. The STBY BATT switch
controls power to or from the standby battery. The standby battery is
available to supply power to the essential bus in the event that
alternator and main battery power sources have both failed.

The primary buses are supplied with power whenever the MASTER
switch is turned on, and are not affected by starter or external power
usage. Each primary bus is also connected to an avionics bus through
a circuit breaker and the AVIONICS BUS 1 and BUS 2 switches. Each
avionics bus is powered when the MASTER switch and the
corresponding AVIONICS switch are in the ON position.

**CAUTION**

BOTH BUS 1 AND BUS 2 AVIONICS SWITCHES
SHOULD BE TURNED OFF TO PREVENT ANY
HARMFUL TRANSIENT VOLTAGE FROM DAMAGING
THE AVIONICS EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO TURNING THE
MASTER SWITCH ON OR OFF, STARTING THE ENGINE
OR APPLYING AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE.

The airplane includes a power distribution module, located on the left
forward side of the firewall, to house all the relays used in the airplane
electrical system. The Alternator Control Unit (ACU), main battery
current sensor, and the external power connector are also housed
within the module.

LOW FUEL L LOW FUEL R

LOW VOLTS HIGH VOLTS

STBY BATT CO LVL HIGH

Refer to the Garmin G1000 CRG Appendix A for more information on

##### **MASTER SWITCH**

The MASTER switch is a two-pole, rocker-type switch. The BAT side of
the switch controls the main battery electrical power to the airplane.
The ALT side of the switch controls the alternator system.

In normal operation, both sides of the switch (ALT and BAT) are ON
simultaneously; however, the BAT side of the switch may be selected
separately as necessary. The ALT side of the switch can not be set to
ON without the BAT side of the switch also being set to ON.

If the alternator system fails, the MASTER switch may be set in the
OFF position to preserve main battery capacity for later in the flight.
With the MASTER switch OFF and the STBY BATT switch in the ARM
position, the standby battery will power the essential bus for a limited
time. Time remaining may be estimated by monitoring essential bus
voltage. At 20 Volts, the standby battery has little or no capacity
remaining.

##### **STANDBY BATTERY SWITCH**

The STBY BATT master switch is a three position (ARM-OFF-TEST)
switch that tests and controls the standby battery system. The energy
level of the battery shall be checked before starting the engine, Refer to
Section 4, by placing the switch in the momentary TEST position and
observing the correct illumination of the TEST lamp found to the right of
the switch. Energy level tests after starting engine are not
recommended.

Placing the switch in the ARM position during the engine start cycle
allows the standby battery to help regulate and filter essential bus
voltage during the start cycle. The switch is set to the ARM position
during normal flight operation to allow the standby battery to charge
and to be ready to power the essential bus in the event of alternator
and main battery failure. Placing the switch in the OFF position
disconnects the standby battery from the essential bus. Operation with
the STBY BATT switch in the OFF position prevents the standby battery
from charging and from automatically providing power should an
electrical system failure occur.
##### **AVIONICS SWITCH**

The AVIONICS switch is a two-pole rocker-type switch that controls
electrical power to AVIONICS BUS 1 and BUS 2. Placing either side of
the rocker switch in the ON position supplies power to the
corresponding avionics bus. Both sides of the AVIONICS switch should
be placed in the OFF position before turning the MASTER switch ON or
OFF, starting the engine, or applying an external power source.

**BUS VOLTAGE (VOLTMETERS)**

Voltage indication (VOLTS) for the main and essential buses is
provided at the bottom of the EIS bar (along the left margin of the MFD
or PFD), labeled M BUS E. Main bus voltage is shown numerically
below the M. Essential bus voltage is displayed numerically below the
E. The main bus voltage is measured at the WARN circuit breaker on
the crossfeed bus. The essential bus voltage is measured at the NAV1
ENG circuit breaker on the essential bus.

Normal bus voltages with the alternator operating shall be about 28.0
volts. When the voltage for either main or essential buses is above 32.0
volts, the numerical value and VOLTS text turns red. This warning
indication, along with the HIGH VOLTS annunciation, is an indication
that the alternator is supplying too high of a voltage. The ALT MASTER
Switch should immediately be positioned to OFF (Refer to Section 3,
Emergency Procedures, HIGH VOLTS ANNUNCIATOR COMES ON).

When the voltage for either main or essential buses is below 24.5 volts,
the numeric value and VOLTS text turns red. This warning indication,
along with the LOW VOLTS annunciation, is an indication that the
alternator is not supplying all the power that is required by the airplane.
Indicated voltages between 24.5 and 28.0 volts may occur during low
engine RPM conditions (Refer to note under LOW VOLTAGE

**AMMETERS**

Current indication (AMPS) for both the main and standby batteries is
provided at the bottom of the EIS bar (along the left margin of the MFD
or PFD), labeled M BATT S. Main battery current is numerically
displayed below the M. Main battery current greater than -1.5 amps is
shown in white. Standby battery current is displayed numerically below
the S. A positive current value (shown in white) indicates that the
battery is charging. A negative current value (shown in amber)
indicates that the battery is discharging. In the event the alternator is
not functioning or the electrical load exceeds the output of the
alternator, the main battery ammeter indicates the main battery
discharge rate.

In the event that standby battery discharge is required, normal steady
state discharge should be less than 4.0 amps. The STBY BATT
annunciator will come on when discharge rates are greater than 0.5
amps for more than 10 seconds. After engine start, with the STBY
BATT switch in the ARM position, the standby battery ammeter should
indicate a charge showing correct charging of the standby battery
system.

**STANDBY BATTERY ANNUNCIATION**

The STBY BATT annunciator will come on when discharge rates are
greater then 0.5 amps for more than 10 seconds. This caution
annunciation is an indication that the alternator and the main battery
are not supplying the power that is required by the essential bus. If the
condition causing the caution can not be resolved, flight should be
terminated as soon as practicable.

#### ELECTRICAL SYSTEM (Continued)
##### **ELECTRICAL SYSTEM MONITORING AND** ANNUNCIATIONS (Continued)

**LOW VOLTAGE ANNUNCIATION**

A signal from the ACU, located inside the power distribution module,
provides the trigger for a red LOW VOLTS annunciation shown on the
PFD. LOW VOLTS is displayed when the main bus voltage measured
in the power distribution module is below 24.5 volts. The LOW VOLTS
warning annunciation is an indication that the alternator is not supplying
the power that is required by the airplane. If the conditions causing the
LOW VOLTS warning can not be resolved, nonessential electrical loads
should be eliminated and the flight should be terminated as soon as
practicable.

**NOTE**

During low RPM operation, with a high electrical load on the
system, such as during a low RPM taxi, the LOW VOLTS
annunciation may come on, the bus voltage values may
turn red, and main battery ammeter discharge indications
may occur. Under these conditions, increase RPM or
decrease electrical loads to reduce demand on the battery.

In the event an overvoltage condition (or other alternator fault) occurs,
the ACU will automatically open the ALT FIELD circuit breaker,
removing alternator field current and stopping alternator output. The
main battery will then supply current to the electrical system as shown
by a discharge (negative number) on the M BATT ammeter. The LOW
VOLTS annunciator will come on when the system voltage drops below
24.5 volts. Set the ALT FIELD circuit breaker to the ON position (push
in) to energize the ACU. If the warning annunciation goes out and the
main battery (M BATT) ammeter indicates positive current, normal
alternator charging has resumed. If the annunciator comes on again, or
the ALT FIELD circuit breaker opens again, an alternator malfunction
has occurred. If the circuit breaker opens again, do not SET it to the ON
position again. Have a qualified technician determine the cause and
correct the malfunction. Turn off nonessential electrical loads and land
as soon as practicable.

The ALT FIELD circuit breaker may open on occasion during normal
engine starts due to transient voltages. Provided that normal alternator
output is resumed after the ALT FIELD circuit breaker is reset, these
occurrences are considered nuisance events. If the ALT FIELD circuit
breaker opens after reset, do not close again. Repeated occurrences
indicate a problem with the electrical system that must be corrected by
a qualified maintenance technician before flight.

**HIGH VOLTAGE ANNUNCIATION**

The HIGH VOLTS annunciator will come on when main or essential bus

Individual system circuit breakers are found on the circuit breaker panel
below the pilot's control wheel. All circuit breakers on ESSENTIAL
BUS, AVIONICS BUS 1 and AVIONICS BUS 2 are capable of being
opened, or disengaged from the electrical system, by pulling straight
out on the outer ring for emergency electrical load management. Using
a circuit breaker as a switch is discouraged since the practice will
decrease the life of the circuit breaker. All circuit breakers on
ELECTRICAL BUS 1, ELECTRICAL BUS 2 and CROSSFEED BUS
are not capable of being opened or disengaged.

The power distribution module uses three push-to-reset circuit breakers
for the electrical bus feeders. A fast blow automotive type fuse is used
at the standby battery. The standby battery current shunt circuit uses
two field replaceable fuses located on the standby battery controller
printed circuit board.

Most Garmin G1000 equipment has internal non-field replaceable

Exterior lighting consists of navigation lights on the wing tips and the tip
of the vertical stabilizer, landing/taxi lights located on the left wing
leading edge, a flashing beacon mounted on top of the vertical
stabilizer, and a strobe light on each wing tip.

Two courtesy lights are recessed into the lower surfaces of each wing
and provide illumination for each cabin door area. The switch for the
courtesy lights is found on the pilot's overhead console. The rear dome
light and under-wing courtesy lights share the same control switch.
Pressing the rear dome light switch will make the lights come on and
pressing it again will make the lights go out.

All other exterior lights are operated by switches found on the lighted
switch panel to the left of the PFD. Exterior lights are grouped together
in the LIGHTS section of the switch panel. To activate the BEACON,
LAND (landing light), TAXI (taxi light), NAV, and STROBE light(s), place
the switch in the up position. Circuit breakers for the lights are found on
the lighted circuit breaker panel on the lower left instrument panel,
below the PFD. Circuit breakers are grouped by electrical bus with
BEACON and LAND on ELECTRICAL BUS 1 and TAXI, NAV and
STROBE on ELECTRICAL BUS 2.

**NOTE**

The strobes and flashing beacon should not be used when
flying through clouds or overcast; the flashing light reflected

Flood lighting is accomplished using two dimmable lights in the front
crew area and one dome light in the rear passenger area. These lights
are contained in the overhead console, and are controlled by dimmer
controls for the front flood lights, and an on-off type push button switch
for the rear dome light. The front flood lights can be rotated to provide
directional lighting for the pilot and front passenger. The rear dome light
provides for general illumination in the rear cabin area. Rear dome light
and courtesy lights, located under the wing, share the same control
switch.

Lighting of the switch panel, circuit breaker panel, engine controls and
environmental control panel is accomplished by using internally lit LED
panels. Rotating the SW/CB PANELS dimmer, found on the switch
panel in the DIMMING group, controls the lighting level for both panels.
Rotating the dimmer counterclockwise decreases light intensity from
the highest level to off.

Pedestal lighting consists of a LED strip light incorporated into the
Throttle/Flap Control Lever panel located on the bottom of the center

Rotating the dimmer control counterclockwise decreases light intensity
from the highest level to off.

Pilot's chart (map) lighting is accomplished by use of a rheostat and a
light assembly, both found on the lower surface of the pilot's control
wheel. The light provides downward illumination from the bottom of the
control wheel to the pilot's lap area. To operate the light, first turn the
NAV light switch ON, and then adjust the map light intensity using the
knurled rheostat knob. Rotating the dimmer clockwise (when facing up)
increases light intensity, and rotating the dimmer counterclockwise
decreases light intensity.

Regardless of the light system in question, the most probable cause of
a light failure is a burned out bulb. However, in the event any lighting
systems fails to come on, check the appropriate circuit breaker. For
interior lighting failure check the PANEL LTS circuit breaker, and for
exterior lighting failure check the associated light function circuit
breaker (i.e. landing light, LAND LT circuit breaker). If the circuit
breaker has opened, and there is no obvious indication of a short circuit
(smoke or odor), turn the affected lights OFF, reset the circuit breaker,
and turn the lights ON again. If the circuit breaker opens again, do not
reset until maintenance has been performed.

#### **CABIN HEATING, VENTILATING AND DEFROSTING** **SYSTEM**

The temperature and volume of airflow into the cabin can be regulated
by manipulation of the push-pull CABIN HT and CABIN AIR control
knobs, Refer to Figure 7-8. Both control knobs are the double button
locking-type and permit intermediate control settings.

For cabin ventilation, pull the CABIN AIR control knob full out. To raise
the air temperature, pull the CABIN HT control knob out approximately
1/4 to 1/2 inch for a small amount of cabin heat. Additional heat is
available by pulling the CABIN HT control knob out farther; maximum
heat is available with the CABIN HT control knob pulled full out and the
CABIN AIR control knob pushed full in. When no heat is desired in the
cabin, the CABIN HT control knob is pushed full in.

Front cabin heat and ventilating air is supplied by outlet holes spaced
across a cabin manifold just forward of the pilot's and front passenger's
feet. Rear cabin heat and air is supplied by two ducts from the manifold,
one extending down each side of the cabin to an outlet just aft of the
rudder pedals at floor level. Windshield defrost air is also supplied by
two ducts leading from the cabin manifold to defroster outlets near the
lower edge of the windshield. Two knobs control sliding valves in either
defroster outlet to permit regulation of defroster airflow.

Separate adjustable ventilators supply additional air; one near each
upper corner of the windshield supplies air for the pilot and front
passenger, and two ventilators are available for the rear cabin area to
supply air to the rear seat passengers. There are additional ventilators
located in various positions in the cockpit.

#### **PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENTS**

The pitot-static system uses a heated total pressure (pitot) head
mounted on the lower surface of the left wing, external static port
mounted on the left side of the forward fuselage and associated
plumbing to connect the air data computer and the conventional pitotstatic instruments to the sources.

The heated pitot system uses an electrical heating element built in the
body of the pitot head. The PITOT HEAT control switch is found on the
switch panel below the lower left corner of the PFD. The PITOT HEAT
circuit breaker is found on the circuit breaker panel at the lower left side
of the pilot panel.

A static pressure alternate source valve (ALT STATIC AIR) is located
adjacent to the throttle control. The ALT STATIC AIR valve provides
static pressure from inside the cabin if the external static pressure
source becomes blocked.

If erroneous instrument readings are suspected due to water or ice in
the pressure line going to the standard external static pressure source,
the alternate static source valve should be pulled on.

Pressures within the cabin will vary with open heaters/vents and
windows. Refer to Section 5, Figure 5-1 (Sheet 2), for the Airspeed
Calibration, Alternate Static Source correction chart.

#### **VACUUM SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENTS**

The vacuum system, Refer to Figure 7-9, provides the vacuum
necessary to operate the standby attitude indicator. The system
consists of one engine-driven vacuum pump, a vacuum regulator, the
standby attitude indicator, a vacuum system air filter, and a vacuum
transducer. The vacuum transducer provides a signal to the engine
display that is processed and displayed as vacuum on the EIS ENGINE
page. If available vacuum, from the engine-driven vacuum pump, drops
below 3.5 in.hg., the LOW VACUUM annunciator will display in amber
on the PFD.
##### **ATTITUDE INDICATOR**

The standby attitude indicator is a vacuum-powered gyroscopic
instrument, found on the center instrument panel below the MFD. The
attitude indicator includes a low-vacuum warning flag (GYRO) that
comes into view when the vacuum is below the level necessary for

#### **CLOCK/O.A.T. INDICATOR**

A numerical time or clock window, based on GPS time, and an outside
air temperature (O.A.T.) indicator window are provided along the lower
edge of the PFD. The O.A.T. indicator uses an air temperature sensor
located on top of the cabin.
#### **STALL WARNING SYSTEM**

The airplane is equipped with a pneumatic-type stall warning system
consisting of an inlet in the leading edge of the left wing, an airoperated horn near the upper left corner of the windshield, and
associated plumbing. As the airplane approaches a stall, the low
pressure on the upper surface of the wings moves forward around the
leading edge of the wings. This low pressure creates a differential
pressure in the stall warning system which draws air through the
warning horn, resulting in a audible warning at 5 to 10 knots above stall
in all flight conditions.

The stall warning system should be checked during the preflight
inspection by applying suction to the system either by placing a clean
handkerchief over the vent opening and applying suction or using some
other type of suction device to activate the warning horn. The system is
operational if the warning horn sounds when suction is applied.

#### **STANDARD AVIONICS**

The Garmin G1000 Avionics System is an integrated flight control and
navigation system. The system combines primary flight instruments,
communications, airplane system information and navigational
information all displayed on two color displays. The G1000 system
consists of the following pieces of equipment:
##### **GARMIN DISPLAY UNITS (GDU)**

Two identical units are mounted on the instrument panel. One, located
in front of the pilot, is configured as a PFD. A second panel, located to
the right, is configured as a MFD.

The PFD displays roll and pitch information, heading and course
navigation information, plus altitude, airspeed and vertical speed
information to the pilot. The PFD also controls and displays all
communication and navigation frequencies as well as displaying
warning/status annunciations of airplane systems.

The MFD displays a large scalable, moving map that corresponds to
the airplane's current location. Data from other components of the
system can be overlaid on this map. Location and direction of
movement of nearby aircraft, lightning and weather information can all
be displayed on the MFD. The MFD is also the principle display for all
of the engine, fuel, and electrical system parameters.

The reversionary mode places the flight information and basic engine
information on both the PFD and the MFD. This feature allows the pilot
full access to all necessary information should either of the display
screens malfunction.

GFC 700 AFCS AND MAINTENANCE
#### **INTRODUCTION**

This section contains factory recommended procedures for proper
ground handling and routine care and servicing of your airplane. It also
identifies certain inspection and maintenance requirements which must
be followed if your airplane is to retain that new airplane performance
and dependability. It is important to follow a planned schedule of
lubrication and preventive maintenance based on climatic and flying
conditions encountered in your local area.

Keep in touch with your local Cessna Service Station and take
advantage of their knowledge and experience. Your Cessna Service
Station knows your airplane and how to maintain it, and will remind you
when lubrications and oil changes are necessary, as well as other
seasonal and periodic services.

The airplane should be regularly inspected and maintained in
accordance with information found in the airplane maintenance manual
and in company issued service bulletins and service newsletters. All
service bulletins pertaining to the airplane by serial number should be
accomplished and the airplane should receive repetitive and required
inspections. Cessna does not condone modifications, whether by
Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) or otherwise, unless these
certificates are held and/or approved by Cessna. Other modifications
may void warranties on the airplane since Cessna has no way of
knowing the full effect on the overall airplane. Operation of an airplane
that has been modified may be a risk to the occupants, and operating
procedures and performance data set forth in the POH may no longer
be considered accurate for the modified airplane.

MODEL 172S NAV III AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE
GFC 700 AFCS AND MAINTENANCE
#### **AIRPLANE INSPECTION PERIODS**
##### **FAA REQUIRED INSPECTIONS**

As required by U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations, all civil aircraft of
U.S. registry must undergo a complete inspection (annual) each twelve
calendar months. In addition to the required annual inspection, aircraft
operated commercially (for hire) must have a complete inspection
every 100 hours of operation.

The FAA may require other inspections by the issuance of
airworthiness directives applicable to the airplane, engine, propeller
and components. It is the responsibility of the owner/operator to ensure
compliance with all applicable airworthiness directives, and when the
inspections are repetitive, to take appropriate steps to prevent
inadvertent noncompliance.
##### **CESSNA INSPECTION PROGRAMS**

In lieu of the 100 hour and annual inspection requirements, an airplane
may be inspected in accordance with a Progressive Care Inspection
Program or a PhaseCard Inspection Program. Both programs offer
systems which allow the work load to be divided into smaller operations
that can be accomplished in shorter time periods.

The Cessna Progressive Care Inspection Program allows an airplane
to be inspected and maintained in four operations. The four operations
are recycled each 200 hours and are recorded in a specially provided
Aircraft Inspection Log as each operation is conducted.

The PhaseCard Inspection Program offers a parallel system for highutilization flight operations (approximately 600 flight hours per year).
This system utilizes 50 hour intervals (Phase 1 and Phase 2) to inspect
high-usage systems and components. At 12 months or 600 flight hours,
whichever occurs first, the airplane undergoes a complete (Phase 3)
inspection.

Regardless of the inspection method selected, the owner should keep
in mind that 14 CFR 43 and 14 CFR 91 establishes the requirement
that properly certified agencies or personnel accomplish all required
FAA inspections and most of the manufacturer recommended
inspections.

SECTION 8 CESSNA
AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE MODEL 172S NAV III
AND MAINTENANCE GFC 700 AFCS
#### AIRPLANE INSPECTION PERIODS (Continued)
##### **CESSNA CUSTOMER CARE PROGRAM**

Specific benefits and provisions of the Cessna Warranty plus other
important benefits for you are contained in your Customer Care
Program Handbook supplied with your airplane. The Customer Care
Program Handbook should be thoroughly reviewed and kept in the
airplane at all times.

You will also want to return to your Cessna Service Station either at 50
hours for your first Progressive Care Operation, or at 100 hours for your
first 100 hour inspection depending on which program you choose to
establish for your airplane. While these important inspections will be
performed for you by any Cessna Service Station, in most cases you
will prefer to have the Cessna Service Station from whom you
purchased the airplane accomplish this work.
#### **PILOT CONDUCTED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE**

A certified pilot who owns or operates an airplane not used as an air
carrier is authorized by 14 CFR 43 to perform limited maintenance on
his airplane. Refer to 14 CFR 43 for a list of the specific maintenance
operations which are allowed.

**NOTE**

Pilots operating airplanes of other than U.S. registry should
refer to the regulations of the country of certification for
information on preventive maintenance that may be
performed by pilots.

A Maintenance Manual must be obtained prior to performing any
preventive maintenance to ensure that proper procedures are followed.
A Cessna Service Station should be contacted for further information or
for required maintenance which must be accomplished by appropriately
licensed personnel.

CESSNA SECTION 8
MODEL 172S NAV III AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE
GFC 700 AFCS AND MAINTENANCE
#### **ALTERATIONS OR REPAIRS**

It is essential that the FAA be contacted prior to any alterations on the
airplane to ensure that airworthiness of the airplane is not violated.
Alterations or repairs to the airplane must be accomplished by licensed
personnel, utilizing only FAA Approved components and FAA Approved
data, such as Cessna Service Bulletins.
#### **GROUND HANDLING**
##### **TOWING**

The airplane is most easily and safely maneuvered by hand with the
tow bar attached to the nosewheel (the tow bar is stowed on the side of
the baggage area). When towing with a vehicle, do not exceed the
nose gear turning angle of 30° either side of center, or damage to the
nose landing gear will result.

**CAUTION**

REMOVE ANY INSTALLED RUDDER LOCK BEFORE
TOWING.

If the airplane is towed or pushed over a rough surface during
hangaring, watch that the normal cushioning action of the nose strut
does not cause excessive vertical movement of the tail and the
resulting contact with low hangar doors or structure. A flat nose tire or
deflated strut will also increase tail height.
##### **PARKING**

When parking the airplane, head into the wind and set the parking
brake. Do not set the parking brake during cold weather when
accumulated moisture may freeze the brakes, or when the brakes are
overheated. Install the control wheel lock and chock the wheels. In
severe weather and high wind conditions, tie the airplane down as
outlined in the following paragraph.

AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE MODEL 172S NAV III
AND MAINTENANCE GFC 700 AFCS
#### GROUND HANDLING (Continued)
##### **TIEDOWN**

Proper tiedown procedure is the best precaution against damage to the
parked airplane by gusty or strong winds. To tiedown the airplane
securely, proceed as follows:
1. Set the parking brake and install the control wheel lock.
2. Install a surface control lock over the fin and rudder.
3. Tie sufficiently strong ropes or chains (700 pounds tensile
strength) to the wing, tail and nose tiedown fittings and secure
each rope or chain to a ramp tiedown.
4. Install a pitot tube cover.
##### **JACKING**

When a requirement exists to jack the entire airplane off the ground, or
when wing jack points are used in the jacking operation, refer to the
Maintenance Manual for specific procedures and equipment required.

Individual main gear may be jacked by using the jack pad which is
incorporated in the main landing gear strut step bracket. When using
the individual gear strut jack pad, flexibility of the gear strut will cause
the main wheel to slide inboard as the wheel is raised, tilting the jack.
The jack must then be lowered for a second jacking operation. Do not
jack both main wheels simultaneously using the individual main gear
jack pads.

**CAUTION**

DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE ON THE ELEVATOR OR
HORIZONTAL STABILIZER SURFACES. WHEN
PUSHING ON THE TAILCONE, ALWAYS APPLY
PRESSURE AT A BULKHEAD TO AVOID BUCKLING THE
SKIN.

If nose gear maintenance is required, the nosewheel may be raised off
the ground by pressing down on a tailcone bulkhead, just forward of the
horizontal stabilizer, and allowing the tail to rest on the tail tiedown ring.

GFC 700 AFCS AND MAINTENANCE
#### GROUND HANDLING (Continued)
##### JACKING (Continued)

To assist in raising and holding the nosewheel off the ground, ground
anchors should be utilized at the tail tiedown point.

**NOTE**

Ensure that the nose will be held off the ground under all
conditions by means of suitable stands or supports under
weight supporting bulkheads near the nose of the airplane.
##### **LEVELING**

Longitudinal leveling of the airplane is accomplished by placing a level
on leveling screws located on the left side of the tailcone. Deflate the
nose tire and/or lower or raise the nose strut to properly center the
bubble in the level. Corresponding points on both upper door sills may
be used to level the airplane laterally.
##### **FLYABLE STORAGE**

Engines in airplanes that are flown every 30 days or less may not
achieve normal service life because of internal corrosion. Corrosion
occurs when moisture from the air and the products of combustion
combine to attack cylinder walls and bearing surfaces during periods
when the airplane is not flown.

The minimum recommended operating frequency for the engine is one
continuous flight hour (not counting taxi, takeoff and landing time) with
oil temperatures of 165°F to 200°F every 30 days or less (depending on
location and storage conditions). Airplanes operated close to oceans,
lakes, rivers and in humid regions are in greater need of engine
preservation than airplanes operated in arid regions. Appropriate
engine preservation procedures must be practiced by the owner or
operator of the airplane based on present environmental conditions and
the frequency of airplane activity.

**NOTE**

The engine manufacturer does not recommend pulling the
engine through by hand during storage periods.

#### GROUND HANDLING (Continued)
##### FLYABLE STORAGE (Continued)

If the airplane is to remain inactive for more than 30 days, consult the
latest revision of Textron Lycoming Service Letter L180
(www.lycoming.textron.com).

It is recommended when storing the airplane for any period of time to
keep fuel tanks full to minimize condensation in tanks. Keep the battery
fully charged to prevent the electrolyte from freezing in cold weather.
Refer to the Maintenance Manual for proper airplane storage
procedures.
#### **SERVICING**

In addition to the Preflight Inspection covered in Section 4 of this POH,
complete servicing, inspection and test requirements for your airplane
are detailed in the Maintenance Manual. The Maintenance Manual
outlines all items which require attention at specific intervals plus those
items which require servicing, inspection, and/or testing at special
intervals.

Since Cessna Service Stations conduct all service, inspection, and test
procedures in accordance with applicable Maintenance Manuals, it is
recommended that you contact a Cessna Service Station concerning
these requirements and begin scheduling your airplane for service at
the recommended intervals.

Cessna Progressive Care ensures that these requirements are
accomplished at the required intervals to comply with the 100 hour or
annual inspection as previously covered.

Depending on various flight operations, your local government aviation
agency may require additional service, inspections, or tests. For these
regulatory requirements, owners should check with local aviation
officials where the airplane is being operated.

For quick and ready reference, quantities, materials and specifications
for frequently used service items are as follows.

#### OIL (Continued)
##### **CAPACITY OF ENGINE SUMP**

The engine has a total capacity of 9 quarts, with the oil filter accounting
for approximately 1 quart of that total. The engine oil sump has a
capacity of 8 quarts. The engine must not be operated on less than 5
quarts (as measured by the dipstick). For extended flights, the engine
should be filled to capacity.
##### **OIL AND OIL FILTER CHANGE**

After the first 25 hours of operation, drain the engine oil sump and
replace the filter. Refill sump with straight mineral oil and use until a
total of 50 hours has accumulated or oil consumption has stabilized;
then change to ashless dispersant oil. Ashless dispersant oil (and oil
filter) should be changed at time intervals set forth by the engine
manufacturer.

**NOTE**

During the first 25 hour oil and filter change, a general
inspection of the overall engine compartment is required.
Items which are not normally checked during a preflight
inspection should be given special attention. Hoses, metal
lines and fittings should be inspected for signs of oil and
fuel leaks, and checked for abrasions, chafing, security,
proper routing and support, and evidence of deterioration.
Inspect the intake and exhaust systems for cracks,
evidence of leakage, and security of attachment. Engine
controls and linkages should be checked for freedom of
movement through their full range, security of attachment
and evidence of wear. Inspect wiring for security, chafing,
burning, defective insulation, loose or broken terminals,
heat deterioration, and corroded terminals. Check the
alternator belt in accordance with Maintenance Manual
instructions, and retighten if necessary. A periodic check of
these items during subsequent servicing operations is
recommended.

AND MAINTENANCE GFC 700 AFCS
#### FUEL (Continued)
##### **FUEL ADDITIVES**

Strict adherence to recommended preflight draining instructions as
called for in Section 4 will eliminate any free water accumulations from
the tank sumps. While small amounts of water may still remain in
solution in the gasoline, it will normally be consumed and go unnoticed
in the operation of the engine.

One exception to this can be encountered when operating under the
combined effect of: (1) use of certain fuels, with (2) high humidity
conditions on the ground (3) followed by flight at high altitude and low
temperature. Under these unusual conditions, small amounts of water
in solution can precipitate from the fuel stream and freeze in sufficient
quantities to induce partial icing of the engine fuel system.

While these conditions are quite rare and will not normally pose a
problem to owners and operators, they do exist in certain areas of the
world and consequently must be dealt with, when encountered.

Therefore, to help alleviate the possibility of fuel icing occurring under
these unusual conditions, it is permissible to add isopropyl alcohol or
Diethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether (DiEGME) compound to the fuel
supply.

The introduction of alcohol or DiEGME compound into the fuel provides
two distinct effects: (1) it absorbs the dissolved water from the gasoline
and (2) alcohol has a freezing temperature depressant effect.

**NOTE**

When using fuel additives, it must be remembered that the
final goal is to obtain a correct fuel to additive ratio in the
tank, and not just with fuel coming out of the refueling
nozzle. For example, adding 15 gallons of correctly
proportioned fuel to a tank which contains 20 gallons of
untreated fuel will result in a lower than acceptable
concentration level to the 35 gallons of fuel which now
reside in the tank.

#### FUEL (Continued)
##### FUEL ADDITIVES (Continued)

Alcohol, if used, is to be blended with the fuel in a concentration of 1%
by volume. Concentrations greater than 1% are not recommended
since they can be detrimental to fuel tank materials.

The manner in which the alcohol is added to the fuel is significant
because alcohol is most effective when it is completely dissolved in the
fuel. To ensure proper mixing, the following is recommended:

1. For best results, the alcohol should be added during the fueling
operation by pouring the alcohol directly on the fuel stream
issuing from the fueling nozzle.
2. An alternate method that may be used is to premix the complete
alcohol dosage with some fuel in a separate clean container
(approximately 2-3 gallon capacity) and then transferring this
mixture to the tank prior to the fuel operation.

#### FUEL (Continued)
##### FUEL ADDITIVES (Continued)

Diethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether (DiEGME) compound must be
carefully mixed with the fuel in concentrations between 0.10%
(minimum) and 0.15% (maximum) of total fuel volume. Refer to Figure
8-1 for a DiEGME-to-fuel mixing chart.

**WARNING**

**ANTI-ICING ADDITIVE IS DANGEROUS TO HEALTH**
**WHEN BREATHED AND/OR ABSORBED INTO THE**
**SKIN.**

**CAUTION**

MIXING OF DIEGME WITH FUEL IS EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT. A CONCENTRATION IN EXCESS OF THAT
RECOMMENDED (0.15% BY VOLUME MAXIMUM) MAY
RESULT IN DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO THE FUEL
TANK AND SEALANT, AND DAMAGE TO O-RINGS AND
SEALS USED IN THE FUEL SYSTEM AND ENGINE
COMPONENTS. A CONCENTRATION OF LESS THAN
THAT RECOMMENDED (0.10% BY TOTAL VOLUME
MINIMUM) WILL RESULT IN INEFFECTIVE TREATMENT.
USE ONLY BLENDING EQUIPMENT THAT IS
RECOMMENDED BY THE MANUFACTURER TO OBTAIN
PROPER PROPORTIONING.

Prolonged storage of the airplane will result in a water buildup in the
fuel which leeches out the additive. An indication of this is when an
excessive amount of water accumulates in the fuel tank sumps. The
concentration can be checked using a differential refractometer. It is
imperative that the technical manual for the differential refractometer be
followed explicitly when checking the additive concentration.

#### FUEL (Continued)
##### **FUEL CONTAMINATION**

Fuel contamination is usually the result of foreign material present in
the fuel system, and may consist of water, rust, sand, dirt, microbes or
bacterial growth. In addition, additives that are not compatible with fuel
or fuel system components can cause the fuel to become
contaminated.

Before each flight and after each refueling, use a clear sampler cup and
drain at least a cupful of fuel from each fuel tank drain location and from
the fuel strainer quick drain valve to determine if contaminants are
present, and to ensure the airplane has been fueled with the proper
grade of fuel.

If contamination is detected, drain **all** fuel drain points again, including
the fuel reservoir tank and fuel selector drain valves, and then gently
rock the wings and lower the tail to the ground to move any additional
contaminants to the sampling points. Take repeated samples from all
fuel drain points until **all** contamination has been removed. If, after
repeated sampling, evidence of contamination still exists, the airplane
should not be flown. Tanks should be drained and system purged by
qualified maintenance personnel. All evidence of contamination must
be removed before further flight. If the airplane has been serviced with
the improper fuel grade, defuel completely and refuel with the correct
grade. Do not fly the airplane with contaminated or unapproved fuel.

In addition, Owners/Operators who are not acquainted with a particular
fixed base operator should be assured that the fuel supply has been
checked for contamination and is properly filtered before allowing the
airplane to be serviced. Fuel tanks should be kept full between flights,
provided weight and balance considerations will permit, to reduce the
possibility of water condensing on the walls of partially filled tanks.

To further reduce the possibility of contaminated fuel, routine
maintenance of the fuel system should be performed in accordance
with the airplane Maintenance Manual. Only the proper fuel, as
recommended in this POH, should be used, and fuel additives should
not be used unless approved by Cessna and the Federal Aviation
Administration.

AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE MODEL 172S NAV III
AND MAINTENANCE GFC 700 AFCS
#### **CLEANING AND CARE**
##### **WINDSHIELD AND WINDOWS**

The plastic windshield and windows should be cleaned with an airplane
windshield cleaner. Apply the cleaner sparingly with soft cloths, and rub
with moderate pressure until all dirt, oil scum and bug stains are
removed. Allow the cleaner to dry, then wipe it off with soft flannel
cloths.

**CAUTION**

NEVER USE GASOLINE, BENZENE, ALCOHOL,
ACETONE, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, ANTI-ICE FLUID,
LACQUER THINNER OR GLASS CLEANER TO CLEAN
THE PLASTIC. THESE MATERIALS WILL ATTACK THE
PLASTIC AND MAY CAUSE IT TO CRAZE.

If a windshield cleaner is not available, the plastic can be cleaned with
soft cloths moistened with Stoddard solvent to remove oil and grease.
Follow by carefully washing with a mild detergent and plenty of water.
Rinse thoroughly, then dry with a clean moist chamois.

Do not rub the plastic with a dry cloth since this builds up an
electrostatic charge which attracts dust. Waxing with a good
commercial wax will finish the cleaning job. A thin, even coat of wax,
polished out by hand with clean soft flannel cloths, will fill in minor
scratches and help prevent further scratching.

Do not use a canvas cover on the windshield unless freezing rain or
sleet is anticipated since the cover may scratch the plastic surface.

MODEL 172S NAV III AIRPLANE HANDLING, SERVICE
GFC 700 AFCS AND MAINTENANCE
#### CLEANING AND CARE (Continued)
##### **PAINTED SURFACES**

The painted exterior surfaces of your new Cessna have a durable, long
lasting finish.

Generally, the painted surfaces can be kept bright by washing with
water and mild soap, followed by a rinse with water and drying with
cloths or a chamois. Harsh or abrasive soaps or detergents which
cause corrosion or scratches should never be used. Remove stubborn
oil and grease with a cloth moistened with Stoddard solvent. Take
special care to make sure that the exterior graphics are not touched by
the solvent. For complete care of exterior graphics, refer to the
Maintenance Manual.

To seal any minor surface chips or scratches and protect against
corrosion, the airplane should be waxed regularly with a good
automotive wax applied in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions. If the airplane is operated in a seacoast or other salt water
environment, it must be washed and waxed more frequently to assure
adequate protection. Special care should be taken to seal around rivet
heads and skin laps, which are the areas most susceptible to corrosion.
A heavier coating of wax on the leading edges of the wings and tail and
on the cowl nose cap and propeller spinner will help reduce the
abrasion encountered in these areas. Reapplication of wax will
generally be necessary after cleaning with soap solution or after
chemical deicing operations.

When the airplane is parked outside in cold climates and it is necessary
to remove ice before flight, care should be taken to protect the painted
surfaces during ice removal with chemical liquids. Isopropyl alcohol will
satisfactorily remove ice accumulations without damaging the paint.
However, keep the isopropyl alcohol away from the windshield and
cabin windows since it will attack the plastic and may cause it to craze.

AND MAINTENANCE GFC 700 AFCS
#### CLEANING AND CARE (Continued)
##### **PROPELLER CARE**

Preflight inspection of propeller blades for nicks, and wiping them
occasionally with an oily cloth to clean off grass and bug stains will
assure long blade life. Small nicks on the propeller, particularly near the
tips and on the leading edges, should be dressed out as soon as
possible since these nicks produce stress concentrations, and if
ignored, may result in cracks or failure of the propeller blade. Never use
an alkaline cleaner on the blades; remove grease and dirt with
Stoddard solvent.
##### **ENGINE CARE**

The engine may be cleaned, using a suitable solvent, in accordance
with instructions in the Maintenance Manual. Most efficient cleaning is
done using a spray type cleaner. Before spray cleaning, ensure that
protection is afforded for components which might be adversely
affected by the solvent. Refer to the airplane Maintenance Manual for
proper lubrication of controls and components after engine cleaning.
The induction air filter should be replaced when its condition warrants,
not to exceed 500 hours.

#### CLEANING AND CARE (Continued)
##### **INTERIOR CARE**

To remove dust and loose dirt from the upholstery and carpet, clean the
interior regularly with a vacuum cleaner.

Blot up any spilled liquid promptly with cleansing tissue or rags. Do not
pat the spot; press the blotting material firmly and hold it for several
seconds. Continue blotting until no more liquid is taken up. Scrape off
sticky materials with a dull knife, then spot clean the area.

Oily spots may be cleaned with household spot removers, used
sparingly. Before using any solvent, read the instructions on the
container and test it on an obscure place on the fabric to be cleaned.
Never saturate the fabric with a volatile solvent; it may damage the
padding and backing materials.

Soiled upholstery and carpet may be cleaned with foam type detergent,
used according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize wetting
the fabric, keep the foam as dry as possible and remove it with a
vacuum cleaner.

For complete information related to interior cleaning, refer to the
Maintenance Manual.
##### **AVIONICS CARE**

The Garmin GDU displays have an anti-reflective coating that is very
sensitive to skin oils, waxes, ammonia, and abrasive cleaners. Clean
the displays as described in the G1000 Cockpit Reference Guide.

SUPPLEMENT 1 MODEL 172S NAV III

GFC 700 AFCS
#### **ARTEX ME406 EMERGENCY LOCATOR** **TRANSMITTER (ELT)** **GENERAL**

The Artex ME406 Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) installation
uses a solid-state 2-frequency transmitter powered by an internal
lithium battery. The ME406 is also equipped with an instrument panelmounted remote switch assembly, that includes a red warning light, and
an external antenna mounted on the top of the tailcone. The remote
switch assembly is installed along the upper right instrument panel and
controls ELT operating modes from the flight crew station. When the
remote switch is set to the ARM position, the transmitter is energized
only when the internal "G” switch senses longitudinal inertia forces per
TSO-C91a/TSO-C126. When the remote switch is set to the ON
position, the transmitter is immediately energized.

The ME406 transmitter unit is located in the tailcone along the right
side behind the baggage compartment aft panel. On the ELT
transmitter unit is a panel containing an ARM/ON switch and a
transmitter warning light.

The ELT installation uses two different warnings to tell the pilot when
the ELT is energized. The aural warning is an unusual sound that is
easily heard by the pilot. The visual warning is a flashing red light
directly above the remote switch that shows the pilot that the ELT has
been activated.

When the ME406 is energized, the ELT transmits the standard swept
tone signal on the international VHF frequency of 121.5 MHz until
battery power is gone. The 121.5 MHz signal is mainly used to pinpoint
the beacon during search and rescue operations, and is monitored by
general aviation, commercial aircraft, and government agencies.

In addition, for the first 24 hours of the ELT being energized, a 406.028
MHz signal is transmitted at 50 second intervals. This transmission
lasts 440 milliseconds and contains identification data programmed into
the ELT and is received by COSPAS/SARSAT satellites. The
transmitted data may include the Aircraft ID, ELT Serial Number,
Country Code, and COSPAS/SARSAT ID.

#### **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

If a forced landing is necessary, set the remote switch to the ON
position before landing. This is very important in remote or
mountainous terrain. The red warning light above the remote switch will
flash and the aural warning will be heard.

After a landing when search and rescue aid is needed, use the ELT as
follows:

**NOTE**

The ELT remote switch assembly could be inoperative if
damaged during a forced landing. If inoperative, the inertia
“G” switch will activate automatically. However, to turn the
ELT OFF and ON again requires manual switching of the
ELT panel switch which is located on the ELT unit.

1. MAKE SURE THE ELT IS ENERGIZED:
a. If the red warning light above the remote switch is not
flashing, set the remote switch to the ON position.
b. Listen for the aural warning. If the COM radio(s) operate and
can be energized safely (no threat of fire or explosion),
energize a COM radio and set the frequency to 121.5 MHz.
The ELT tone should be heard on the COM radio if the ELT
is working correctly. When done, de-energize the COM
radio(s) to conserve the airplane battery power.
c. Make sure that nothing is touching or blocking the ELT
antenna.

2. AFTER RESCUE - Set the remote switch to the ARM position to
de-energize the ELT. If the remote switch does not function, set
the switch on the ME406 (in the tailcone) to the ARM position.

#### **NORMAL PROCEDURES**

When operating in a remote area or over hazardous terrain, it is
recommended that the ELT be inspected by an approved technician
more frequently than required by 14 CFR 91.207.
##### **NORMAL OPERATION**

1. Check that the remote switch (on the upper right instrument
panel) is set to the ARM position.

Normal operation of the ME406 from the flight crew station is only to
de-energize and arm the ELT after it has been accidentally energized
(no emergency).

The ELT can be energized by a lightning strike or hard landing. If the
red light above the remote switch is flashing and the aural warning is
heard, the ELT is energized. Check for the emergency signal on a COM
radio set to 121.5 MHz. To stop the transmissions, set the remote
switch to the ON position momentarily and then set to the ARM
position. Tell the nearest Air Traffic Control facility about the accidental
transmissions as soon as possible to hold search and rescue work to a
minimum.

digital tuning in the frequency range of 200-kHz to 1799-kHz and
eliminates the need for mechanical band switching. The system has a
receiver, a built-in electronic timer, a bearing pointer shown on the
G1000 Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI), and a KA-44B combined
loop and sense antenna. Controls and displays for the Bendix/King
Digital ADF are shown and described in Figure S3-1. The Garmin GMA
1347 Audio Panel is used to control audio output. Audio panel
operation is described in the Garmin G1000 Cockpit Reference Guide.

The Bendix/King Digital ADF can be used for position plotting and
homing procedures, and for aural reception of amplitude modulated
(AM) signals.

The flip-flop frequency display allows switching between preselected
standby and active frequencies by pushing the frequency transfer
button. Both preselected frequencies are stored in a nonvolatile
memory circuit (no battery power required) and displayed in large,
easy-to-read, self-dimming gas discharge numbers. The active
frequency is continuously displayed in the left window, while the right
window will display either the standby frequency or the selected
readout from the built-in electronic timer.

The built-in electronic timer has two timing functions that operate
independently. An automatic flight timer starts when the unit is turned
on. This timer counts up to 59 hours and 59 minutes. An elapsed timer
will count up or down for up to 59 minutes and 59 seconds. When a
preset time interval has been programmed and the countdown reaches
:00, the display will flash for 15 seconds. Since both the flight timer and
elapsed timer operate independently, it is possible to monitor either one
without disrupting the other. The pushbutton controls are internally
lighted. The light intensity is controlled by the AVIONICS dimmer
control.

##### **ADF OPERATION NOTES:**

**ERRONEOUS ADF BEARING DUE TO RADIO FREQUENCY**
**PHENOMENA:**

In the U.S., the FCC, which assigns AM radio frequencies, occasionally
will assign the same frequency to more than one station in an area.
Certain conditions, such as Night Effect, may cause signals from such
stations to overlap. This should be taken into consideration when using
AM broadcast stations for navigation.

Sunspots and atmospheric phenomena may occasionally distort
reception so that signals from two stations on the same frequency will
overlap. For this reason, it is always wise to make positive identification
of the station being tuned, by switching the function selector to ANT
and listening for station call letters.

In the vicinity of electrical storms, an ADF indicator pointer tends to
swing from the station tuned toward the center of the storm.

SUPPLEMENT 3 MODEL 172S NAV III

#### NORMAL PROCEDURES (Continued)
##### ADF OPERATION NOTES: (Continued)

**ELECTRICAL STORMS:**

In the vicinity of electrical storms, an ADF indicator pointer tends to
swing from the station tuned toward the center of the storm.

**NIGHT EFFECT:**

This is a disturbance particularly strong just after sunset and just after
dawn. An ADF indicator pointer may swing erratically at these times. If
possible, tune to the most powerful station at the lowest frequency. If
this is not possible, take the average of pointer oscillations to determine
station bearing.

**MOUNTAIN EFFECT:**

Radio waves reflecting from the surface of mountains may cause the
pointer to fluctuate or show an erroneous bearing. This should be taken
into account when taking bearings over mountainous terrain.

**COASTAL REFRACTION:**

Radio waves may be refracted when passing from land to sea or when
moving parallel to the coastline. This also should be taken into account.
#### **PERFORMANCE**

There is no change in airplane performance when the Bendix/King KR
87 Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) is installed. However, the
installation of an externally mounted antenna or related external
antennas, will result in a minor reduction in cruise performance.
