Alright, cadet, let's go over your flight data. This is your first time in a real aircraft, and that comes with a lot of new sensations and skills to learn. You did a good job of keeping the aircraft pointed generally towards the enemy initially, which shows good recognition of the target. Now, let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain precise control of your aircraft to consistently track the enemy, ensuring you never lose sight.

**How am I doing?**
You started well by maintaining a consistent distance behind the enemy, which is a good initial position for tracking. However, as the enemy aircraft initiated its manoeuvre, your control inputs were either absent or too abrupt, leading to significant deviations in both pitch and heading. This resulted in your aircraft experiencing extreme nose-down attitudes and uncontrolled rolls, triggering frequent stall warnings and ultimately causing you to lose visual contact with the enemy.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to focus on making small, deliberate, and continuous control inputs with the yoke to manage your pitch and roll. Simultaneously, you must actively use the throttle to maintain appropriate airspeed and prevent stalls; if the stall warning activates (an audible alert that your wings are losing lift due to insufficient airspeed or excessive angle of attack, the angle at which your wing meets the oncoming air), immediately apply full power and smoothly reduce your pitch to regain critical airspeed and lift. Developing this coordinated control will allow you to anticipate and react to enemy manoeuvres effectively and maintain continuous tracking.

Alright, recruit, that was your first taste of tracking, and I know it can be a lot to take in! You did a good job of maintaining control before the enemy aircraft started its maneuver, showing you're already getting a feel for the Cessna. That's a solid start!

Before we dive into your performance, let's quickly clarify a few terms you'll hear me use:
*   A **bank angle** refers to how much you tilt the wings of the aircraft using the **yoke** (the control stick).
*   **Coordinated rudder** means correctly using the rudder pedals to keep the aircraft's nose pointed straight into the wind during a turn, preventing a sideways slip or skid. You can usually tell this by keeping the 'ball' centered on the turn coordinator instrument on your G1000.
*   A **stall warning** is that audible alert indicating your wing is losing lift, which happens when your airspeed is too low or you pull the nose up too sharply.
*   Your **airspeed** is simply your speed through the air, measured in Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) on your G1000 Primary Flight Display.

Now, let's get into the specifics of what we observed. Remember, this is all about making you a top-tier pilot.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to precisely match the enemy aircraft's flight path, maintaining constant distance and keeping them directly in your field of view.

**How am I doing?**
You initially held your position well, but consistently fell behind the enemy during their turn, resulting in large heading and pitch deviations, which unfortunately led to frequently losing sight.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to aggressively increase your bank angle with the yoke to match the enemy's turn rate, using coordinated rudder and adjusting throttle to control airspeed, preventing stalls.

Alright, Cadet, excellent job getting in the cockpit for your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed with all the new information, but you've taken the crucial first step. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain consistent visual contact and an optimal tracking position on the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers, minimizing deviations.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good fundamental aircraft control in the initial phase of the flight, maintaining a stable pitch and heading before the enemy began its maneuver. This is a solid foundation, showing you have a good grasp of basic flight controls. However, once the enemy initiated its right turn at around 4 seconds, you struggled to maintain your tracking position. Your 'heading deviation' (how far off your aircraft's nose was from where it *should* have been pointing to follow the enemy) increased significantly, leading to you 'lost sight of enemy' for most of the maneuver. You also frequently activated the 'stall warning' (indicating your wing was losing lift and risking a loss of control), particularly when attempting to turn tightly with the enemy, which suggests you were pulling back too hard on the yoke.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, your immediate focus must be on proactive power management and coordinated control inputs. When the enemy initiates a maneuver, like their right turn, your first response should be to immediately advance the 'throttle ratio' (power setting) to full. This is crucial for gaining and maintaining airspeed ('KIAS' - Knots Indicated Airspeed) and energy, which are essential for your Cessna to turn effectively and prevent stall warnings. Simultaneously, execute smooth, coordinated turns: apply sufficient right 'yoke roll ratio' (turning the yoke left or right to bank the aircraft) to match the enemy's bank angle, and then *simultaneously* apply the appropriate 'yoke pitch ratio' (pulling back or pushing forward on the yoke to control your aircraft's nose up or down) to maintain altitude and tighten your turn, but be careful not to pull so hard that you hear the 'stall warning' activate again. To minimize your 'heading deviation' and avoid losing sight of the enemy, try to "lead" their turn by aiming slightly ahead of their current position in the direction they are turning, rather than reacting to their present position.

Alright, pilot, let's break down that flight. You've just completed your first enemy tracking training flight, and that's a huge step. You've shown good initial control and awareness, which is exactly what we look for in new trainees. Now, let's focus on refining your technique.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to consistently maintain visual contact and an optimal tracking position behind the enemy aircraft throughout their maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You initially maintained good position, but struggled to turn with the enemy, leading to large heading deviations, increasing distance, and frequent stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, when the enemy aircraft initiates a turn, immediately apply coordinated controls: roll aggressively by turning the yoke in the direction of the turn, use the rudder pedals (the foot controls) to keep the turn coordinator's ball centered, and increase throttle to maintain airspeed and prevent stalls.

Alright, listen up, future fighter pilots! This is your first taste of actual tactical flying in a real aircraft, so let's break down your performance. You've taken the first step into a very exciting world, and I'm proud of you for getting airborne.

### What are my goals? (keep the response to this question to 25 words)

Your primary goal is to maintain close visual contact with the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers, ensuring safe and coordinated flight within the Cessna's limits.

### How am I doing?

First off, great job staying behind the enemy aircraft throughout the entire flight. That's a solid foundation for tracking. You consistently kept yourself in a trailing position, which is where you want to be for observation.

However, once the enemy initiated its right turn around the 4.38-second mark, we saw significant challenges. Your response to the enemy's maneuver was quite delayed; your control inputs only became noticeable much later, around the 13-second mark. When you did finally react, your inputs were often too abrupt and uncoordinated. For example, your Angle of Attack (AoA) spiked dangerously high (reaching 18.88 degrees at 13.65 seconds), leading to multiple stall warnings. An Angle of Attack is simply the angle between your wing and the oncoming air, and pulling too hard on the yoke can increase it to a point where the wing stops producing lift, causing a stall. This indicates you were pulling too hard on the yoke without enough speed or coordination.

Critically, your throttle remained at 0.5 (50%) throughout the entire flight. This prevented you from maintaining sufficient speed and energy, especially during the turn. As a direct result, the distance to the enemy aircraft rapidly increased from around 380 meters to over 9000 meters, and you consistently lost sight of the enemy due to massive pitch and heading deviations.

### How to improve?

To improve, we need to focus on three key areas of basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) fundamentals:

1.  **Timely and Coordinated Control Inputs:**
    *   **How to execute:** As soon as the enemy initiates a turn, you must react promptly. For a right turn, apply smooth, sufficient right roll input using the yoke. In the Cessna, for a sustained turn, aim for about 30-45 degrees of bank. As you apply roll, simultaneously use the rudder pedals to keep the slip/skid indicator (the "ball") centered on your G1000's Primary Flight Display (PFD). This ensures a coordinated turn, where your aircraft moves cleanly through the air without slipping or skidding sideways. Avoid abrupt, full deflections of the yoke; smooth inputs are key to precise tracking.

2.  **Active Throttle and Energy Management:**
    *   **How to execute:** Power is your best friend in turns, especially when you're trying to maintain speed or tighten your turn radius to stay close to a maneuvering target. Your throttle remained at 0.5 (50%) which was insufficient. As you initiate your turn, smoothly advance the throttle past 0.5, perhaps to 0.7 or 0.8 (70-80% power), depending on the desired turn rate and how much energy you need to maintain. Always observe your indicated airspeed (KIAS) on the G1000's PFD; maintain a safe airspeed (e.g., above 70 KIAS for a Cessna 172 in a turn) to prevent stalls and ensure you have enough energy to maneuver.

3.  **Maintain Awareness of Angle of Attack and Avoid Stalls:**
    *   **How to execute:** Pulling too hard on the yoke without enough airspeed or power will cause your Angle of Attack to increase rapidly, leading to a stall. The stall warning is there to tell you when you are approaching this critical condition. If you hear the stall warning or notice the AoA increasing rapidly (which you can monitor if your G1000 has an AoA indicator, but more importantly, feel it in the controls becoming "mushy" or soft), immediately reduce your pitch (gently push the yoke forward to nose down) and increase power to recover. This is crucial for safety. For effective tracking, you want to manage your turn rate and energy, not just pull back on the stick. Think about using less aggressive pitch changes and more consistent power to maintain your desired turn.

We'll work on these fundamentals in our next session. You've got the basic understanding of staying behind, now let's refine your control and energy management to stick to that enemy aircraft like glue! You're doing great for your first time, and these are common learning points. We'll get there!

Alright, recruit, that was your first taste of tracking in a real aircraft – a huge step! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed initially. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact and an effective tracking position on the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You did well keeping the aircraft stable during the initial phase of the flight, and importantly, you kept the aircraft flying safely without crashing, which is commendable for a first time. However, once the enemy aircraft began its right turn around the 4.38-second mark, your tracking significantly degraded. This was primarily due to a lack of timely control inputs and consistent throttle management, leading to frequent 'lost sight of enemy' heading deviations and several instances where your **stall warning** activated.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must initiate control inputs much earlier and more assertively. When the enemy aircraft begins its turn, you need to immediately apply appropriate right **yoke roll ratio** (banking the wings) to match their turn, and simultaneously manage your **pitch** (nose up/down) with the **yoke pitch ratio** to maintain your desired **Angle of Attack** (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) for the turn. Crucially, you must actively use the **throttle ratio** to manage your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed) and energy, matching the enemy's speed and preventing undesirable **stall warnings**. Remember to use rudder pedals for coordinated turns to minimize **sideslip angle** (flying sideways through the air) and keep your tracking smooth.

Alright, Trainee! Welcome to the cockpit. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed on your first real flight, but you're here to learn, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Let's look at your flight data from today's enemy tracking exercise.

### What are my goals?
To proficiently track enemy aircraft, maintaining visual contact and optimal position without losing control.

### How am I doing?
You demonstrated initial stability and a good starting position behind the enemy aircraft before it began its maneuver. However, once the enemy initiated its turn, you struggled significantly with control, leading to a rapid increase in deviation, multiple stall warnings, and ultimately losing sight of the target.

### How to improve?

Focus on coordinated, timely, and smooth control inputs, especially when matching enemy maneuvers, and actively manage your energy by adjusting throttle to maintain safe airspeed and prevent stalls.

Here's how to execute that:

1.  **Coordinate Your Turns and Anticipate Enemy Maneuvers:**
    *   **The Problem:** When the enemy aircraft began turning right (around the 4.38-second mark), your aircraft began to roll left, and your heading deviation rapidly increased, indicating you were not following the target. Your control inputs (`yoke roll ratio`) were either absent or very abrupt when they finally appeared.
    *   **The Fix:** Tracking an enemy requires anticipating their movements and applying smooth, coordinated control inputs to match their turn. If the enemy turns right, you must smoothly apply right aileron (turning the yoke to the right) to roll your wings into a right bank. Simultaneously, use your right rudder pedal to keep the slip-skid indicator (often called "the ball") centered on your G1000 Primary Flight Display (PFD). This keeps your turn "coordinated," meaning you're not slipping (sliding sideways towards the inside of the turn) or skidding (sliding sideways towards the outside of the turn). The aspect angle, which is the angle from your aircraft's tail to the enemy aircraft's nose, should ideally remain small (close to 0 degrees) when tracking directly behind them. Practice smooth, continuous control pressure rather than abrupt, large deflections.

2.  **Actively Manage Airspeed and Prevent Stalls:**
    *   **The Problem:** Your throttle setting remained at 0.5 (half power) throughout the entire flight, even when your airspeed (`kias`) dropped significantly during turns, causing your Angle of Attack (AoA) to climb to dangerous levels and triggering repeated `stall warning` indications. A stall occurs when the wings can no longer generate enough lift, often due to too high an AoA or insufficient airspeed. The stall warning horn indicates this is about to happen.
    *   **The Fix:** Turns, especially those with significant bank angles, increase drag and reduce your airspeed. To maintain energy and prevent a stall, you must actively manage your engine power. When initiating a turn, smoothly advance the throttle (increase `throttle ratio`) to add power. Keep an eye on your `kias` on the G1000 PFD; aim to stay within the green arc, which indicates your normal operating speed range. If you hear a stall warning, immediately reduce your AoA by smoothly pushing the yoke forward (reducing `yoke pitch ratio`) to regain airspeed, while simultaneously adding full power (`throttle ratio` to 1.0) and rolling wings level if necessary to recover. Never let your airspeed drop too low in a turn.

Keep practicing, Trainee. You've got the foundational stability; now we need to refine your active control and energy management during dynamic maneuvers. You'll get there!

Alright, trainee, let's break down that tracking flight. You've just experienced your first real taste of aircraft control under a dynamic scenario, and that's a huge step. You showed good initial awareness of the enemy's maneuver, which is a great starting point for developing your tracking skills.

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and optimal tracking distance behind the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You initiated pursuit, which is commendable, but you struggled with delayed and uncoordinated control inputs, leading to significant heading and pitch deviations where you lost sight of the enemy, and you repeatedly encountered stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must immediately initiate a coordinated turn with appropriate yoke (control stick) and rudder pedal inputs as the enemy aircraft maneuvers. For example, when the enemy turned right, you needed to apply right aileron (yoke to the right) and right rudder simultaneously. Simultaneously, smoothly add throttle to maintain your airspeed and energy, which will help you tighten your turn and prevent dangerous stall warnings, keeping the enemy in sight. Remember, "coordinated" means using both aileron and rudder in harmony to prevent "sideslip," which is when the aircraft moves sideways through the air, like a car skidding. Keeping your aircraft coordinated is crucial for efficient and safe turns.

Alright, cadet, great effort out there! This was your first time in a real aircraft, and you handled some challenging situations without crashing, which is a huge win. That shows excellent basic aircraft recovery instincts under pressure.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a stable, close tracking position behind the enemy aircraft, anticipating their maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated persistence in generally staying behind the enemy aircraft, and importantly, you safely avoided a crash despite experiencing multiple stall warnings and extreme attitude changes. However, your control inputs were too aggressive and uncoordinated, leading to erratic flight, frequent loss of visual contact, and significant deviations from the enemy's flight path.

**How to improve?**
Focus on developing smooth, coordinated control inputs. When initiating or recovering from turns, apply aileron (moving the yoke left or right) and simultaneously use the rudder pedals to "step on the ball" on the G1000's slip-skid indicator. This small "ball" is located at the bottom of your Primary Flight Display. Keeping it centered by applying the appropriate rudder input (pushing the pedal on the side the ball is deviating towards) will ensure coordinated flight, minimize drag, and allow for much more precise and stable tracking. Start with very small, gentle inputs and observe the aircraft's response.

Alright, let's go over your flight data. This is your first time in a real aircraft, and you did a great job maintaining your composure and keeping the aircraft safely in the air. That's a huge step, and I'm proud of you for that!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a stable tracking position directly behind the enemy aircraft at a consistent distance.

**How am I doing?**
For your first flight, you demonstrated good composure and maintained aircraft control without crashing, which is commendable. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy and fell significantly behind due to difficulties maintaining position.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to master **proactive energy management and coordinated flight controls.** The most critical area is your throttle: you kept it at a constant setting, but when the enemy turns, you must add power by pushing the throttle forward. This increases your airspeed (KIAS, or Knots Indicated Airspeed) and provides the energy needed to turn with the enemy and prevent falling behind. This increased energy is vital for keeping up. Simultaneously, ensure your turns are coordinated by using appropriate rudder input along with your yoke (control stick) to keep the slip/skid ball centered on your G1000's Primary Flight Display (PFD). The "ball" is a small indicator, usually a white circle, located below the artificial horizon on your main screen; keep it centered using your rudder pedals (left pedal if the ball is left, right pedal if the ball is right). This will make your turns more efficient and prevent the frequent stall warnings you experienced from pulling back too hard on the yoke without enough speed. Remember, it's about smoothly blending power and control inputs to stay with the target.

Alright, Cadet, excellent work on your first tracking flight in the Cessna 172! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed initially, but you successfully kept the aircraft flying and demonstrated great effort in attempting to follow the target. That's a solid start!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain close, consistent visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively managing your aircraft's speed and position.

**How am I doing?**
You did well by staying airborne and not crashing, which is always the first priority! However, your flight data shows you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft, both vertically and horizontally, and experienced multiple stall warnings, indicating difficulty maintaining proper airspeed and relative position during the tracking maneuver.

**How to improve?**
Your most crucial area for improvement is **active throttle management**. Your throttle remained at a constant 50% throughout the entire flight. This means you weren't using engine power to control your airspeed or close the distance to the enemy. This directly led to your airspeed dropping too low during turns, triggering those stall warnings, and the distance to the enemy constantly increasing.

To improve, focus on this:
*   **Use the throttle to control your speed and distance:**
    *   **To close in on the enemy (decrease distance):** Smoothly and gradually push the throttle forward with your left hand. Watch your airspeed (KIAS) on the G1000 display; you want to increase speed to catch up.
    *   **To fall back or maintain distance (increase distance):** Smoothly and gradually pull the throttle back. This will reduce your speed and allow the enemy to pull away or help you maintain your current separation.
    *   **During turns:** When you initiate a turn to follow the enemy, your aircraft naturally wants to slow down. As you roll into the turn, smoothly add a bit of throttle to maintain your desired airspeed and prevent it from dropping too low, which can lead to a stall. Keep an eye on your KIAS to ensure it stays well above the stall warning speed.
*   **Practice smooth, subtle inputs:** Just like steering a car, small, continuous adjustments to the throttle are more effective than large, sudden movements. Think of feathering the power, constantly adjusting to keep your position relative to the target. This active use of the throttle will give you much better control over your flight path and relative position to the enemy.

Alright recruit, excellent work on your first tracking flight in the Cessna 172! It takes courage to get in the cockpit for the first time, and you did a great job reacting to the enemy's initial maneuver, which is a key skill. Most importantly, you kept the aircraft safe throughout the entire flight, and that’s always our top priority!

Here's your specific feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to consistently maintain visual track of the enemy aircraft, while safely managing your Cessna's flight performance.

**How am I doing?**
You reacted quickly when the enemy initiated its turn, which shows good potential for dynamic tracking. However, you consistently struggled to keep the enemy aircraft centered in your view, often losing sight in both pitch (up/down) and heading (left/right). The distance to the enemy also increased significantly throughout the exercise. Your control inputs, especially on the yoke for pitch and roll, were often too large and uncoordinated, leading to several stall warnings – that's when the wing angle to the air, called 'Angle of Attack' (AoA), becomes too high, risking a loss of lift. You also kept the throttle constant, which limited your ability to manage your speed relative to the target.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to refine your control inputs and actively manage your aircraft's energy. When maneuvering, apply smoother, more gradual inputs on the yoke for pitch and roll. Crucially, coordinate your turns by using the rudder pedals along with your yoke roll input to keep the "ball" centered on your G1000's turn coordinator; this prevents "sideslip," where the aircraft moves sideways through the air, ensuring efficient and stable turns. Simultaneously, you must actively use the throttle: increase power to accelerate and close the distance to the enemy, and reduce power when you need to slow down or tighten your turn to prevent overshooting. By smoothly integrating throttle, pitch, and coordinated roll, you’ll maintain better control, keep the enemy in sight, and avoid dangerous conditions like stalls.

Alright, Airman, excellent job getting into the cockpit for your first enemy tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, but you did a fantastic job of staying in the air and not crashing – that's a huge win for a first-timer! Your active control inputs show you're eager to learn and engage.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a consistent visual track on the enemy aircraft, keeping it centered in your field of view and managing your distance.

**How am I doing?**
You initiated the tracking well before the enemy's turn. However, during and after the enemy's right turn, your distance to the target significantly increased, and you struggled to keep the enemy centered. This resulted in frequently losing sight of them in both pitch (pointing too high or low) and heading (pointing too far left or right). We also saw several 'stall warnings', which means your wing was close to losing lift because your Angle of Attack (AoA) was too high for your current airspeed.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, focus on actively managing your airspeed using the throttle. Your distance to the enemy grew significantly because your power setting (throttle ratio) remained constant at 0.5, which wasn't enough to match their movement. When the enemy starts to pull away, smoothly push the throttle lever forward to increase engine RPM and airspeed. This will allow you to close the distance and maintain a better tracking position. Conversely, if you find yourself getting too close, smoothly reduce the throttle. This dynamic throttle control is vital for maintaining a stable tracking solution.

**Instructor's Note on Speeding Up Feedback Generation:**

To speed up future feedback generation, I would implement an automated data analysis pipeline. This would involve:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Structuring:** Automatically loading the flight data into a structured format (e.g., a Pandas DataFrame) for easy manipulation.
2.  **Pre-defined Performance Metrics & Thresholds:** Establishing clear, quantifiable thresholds for "good," "might lose sight," and "lost sight" for pitch and heading deviation. Similarly, defining acceptable ranges for distance, rate of change of distance, AoA, and sideslip.
3.  **Automated Event Detection:** Programmatically identifying critical events such as enemy maneuvers, periods of high deviation, stall warnings (where `stall warning` = 1), and significant changes in distance.
4.  **Prioritization Algorithm:** Developing logic to identify the most impactful areas for improvement based on the frequency and severity of deviations or critical events.
5.  **Templated Feedback Generation:** Using pre-written sentence structures and explanations for common aviation terms, then dynamically inserting the analyzed metrics and identified issues into these templates.
6.  **Conciseness Filters:** Applying algorithms to ensure feedback remains succinct and adheres to word limits for specific sections.

This approach minimizes manual data interpretation and writing, allowing for rapid, consistent, and data-driven feedback.

Alright, cadet, let's review your enemy tracking flight in the Cessna 172. This was likely your first time handling a real aircraft in this scenario, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed. You showed great determination throughout the entire flight, which is a fantastic starting point for any pilot!

### What are my goals?
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy, ensuring stable, coordinated flight while tracking.

### How am I doing?
You demonstrated persistence in trying to track the enemy, which is commendable. However, your control inputs, especially with roll and pitch, were often delayed and overly aggressive, leading to frequent loss of sight and multiple stall warnings, indicated by the rapidly increasing distance.

### How to improve?
To improve, focus on smoother, more precise control inputs. When the enemy aircraft begins a turn, initiate your roll input immediately and gradually, using the yoke to match their bank angle. Crucially, coordinate your turns by applying appropriate rudder (foot pedals) simultaneously to keep the "ball" centered on the G1000's slip-skid indicator. This will prevent uncommanded yaw and excessive sideslip, which can lead to stalls. Additionally, you kept the throttle constant; actively adjust your throttle to manage your airspeed (KIAS) and energy, adding power to keep up or climb, and reducing it to slow down or descend, preventing stalls and improving tracking.

---

### How to speed up feedback generation:

To accelerate the feedback generation process, you can implement a more automated analysis pipeline:

1.  **Automated Data Parsing and Structuring:** Use a programming language (like Python with the Pandas library) to automatically load and parse your flight data. This will convert the dictionary into a structured format (like a DataFrame) that is much easier to analyze programmatically.
2.  **Define Performance Metrics and Thresholds:** Establish clear numerical thresholds for "good," "might lose sight," and "lost sight" for `pitch dev` and `heading dev`. Similarly, define thresholds for acceptable ranges for `roll`, `angle of attack`, and `sideslip angle`.
3.  **Develop Analysis Functions:** Write functions that automatically:
    *   Identify the different phases of the flight (e.g., "before manoeuvre," "enemy turning right," "enemy finished manoeuvre").
    *   Calculate key statistics for each phase (e.g., average `pitch dev`, maximum `roll`, total `stall warning` instances, overall change in `distance`).
    *   Detect specific issues (e.g., `if throttle_ratio` is constant, `if roll` or `pitch` values are extreme, `if stall_warning` is consistently active).
4.  **Implement Conditional Feedback Logic:** Based on the results from your analysis functions, use conditional statements (`if/else`) to select and combine pre-written feedback phrases. For example, if the analysis detects multiple stall warnings, the system would automatically pull the appropriate feedback sentence about managing AoA and airspeed. This allows for dynamic and tailored feedback without manual review of every data point.

By setting up this automated system, you can quickly process new flight data, identify key performance indicators, and generate specific feedback much faster than manual analysis.

Alright, Lieutenant, excellent effort on your first enemy tracking training flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed with all the new sensations and controls, but you've taken the crucial first step into tactical aviation. Let's review your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft while effectively controlling your distance and aircraft energy.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated commendable persistence in attempting to track the enemy throughout the maneuver, which is a vital quality for any pilot. However, the data indicates that your control inputs were often delayed and abrupt, leading to significant distance increases and frequent loss of visual contact.

**How to improve?**
To improve, concentrate on **smooth, coordinated control inputs and active power management**. When the enemy initiates a turn, anticipate their maneuver and immediately apply gentle, simultaneous inputs to your yoke (for roll and pitch) and the appropriate rudder pedal to keep the "slip/skid ball" centered on your G1000 display. The slip/skid ball is a small black ball inside a curved tube, typically found at the bottom of your attitude indicator. Keeping it centered means your turns are "coordinated," preventing you from slipping or skidding through the air. Simultaneously, actively use your throttle to manage your energy; smoothly increase power to tighten your turn and prevent stall warnings, ensuring you maintain optimal airspeed to stay behind the target and close the distance. This integrated approach will help you maintain visual contact and effectively close the distance.

**Goals:** Maintain consistent visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, achieving precise flight control and coordinated turns for optimal pursuit.

**How am I doing?** You showed effort, but lost visual contact multiple times due to large pitch and heading deviations. Aggressive, uncoordinated control inputs also led to several stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
1.  **Smooth Control:** Initiate turns with gentle rudder (foot pedals) in the turn direction, then smooth aileron (yoke roll input) to roll. Keep the slip/skid ball (on your G1000 PFD) centered with rudder to maintain coordinated flight and prevent stalls (which happen when the wing's angle of attack is too high).
2.  **Anticipation:** Begin your turn slightly before the enemy finishes theirs. This smooths your transition, helping you maintain visual and reduce large deviations.

Alright, Trainee, great job on your first flight! It takes courage to get into the cockpit, and you successfully maintained control without crashing, which is the most important thing. Let's break down this flight and see how we can make you an even sharper tracker.

**What are my goals?**
To maintain precise visual track of the enemy aircraft while managing your aircraft's energy and controls effectively.

**How am I doing?**
You did well maintaining control and avoiding a crash, which is commendable for a first flight. However, your tracking was inconsistent, often losing sight of the enemy and falling significantly behind, especially during and after their right turn. For instance, when the enemy initiated its right turn around the 4-second mark, your aircraft rolled left, which is the opposite direction needed to follow. Your distance to the enemy increased from around 387 meters to over 9000 meters by the end, and you experienced multiple stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on executing coordinated turns using simultaneous aileron and rudder inputs to match the enemy's turn direction, while actively managing your airspeed with the throttle. When the enemy turns right, apply smooth right yoke (aileron) input to roll right, and simultaneously apply right rudder pressure with your foot to keep the "ball" centered on the G1000's slip/skid indicator – this ensures a coordinated turn. Concurrently, use the throttle to maintain your desired airspeed; adding power will help prevent stalls from excessive pitch inputs (pulling back on the yoke) and allow you to close distance, while reducing power can help you maintain distance.

Alright, listen up, future fighter pilots! That was your first real taste of tracking an enemy aircraft in a Cessna 172. It's a fundamental skill, and you've just taken a huge step. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and optimal tracking distance to the enemy, ensuring safe, controlled flight.

**How am I doing?**
First, great job on keeping the aircraft safe throughout the flight and not crashing; that's paramount, especially for your first time. You maintained a consistent throttle setting, which shows consistency. However, during the enemy's right turn, you consistently applied left roll input, causing significant heading deviation and losing sight of the target. This led to erratic control inputs and multiple stall warnings as you tried to regain sight. You fell far behind the enemy due to ineffective tracking and power management.

**How to improve?**
1.  **Roll Control:** When the enemy aircraft turns right, you must match their turn by applying *right* roll with the yoke. Push the yoke right to roll right. If they turn left, push the yoke left to roll left. Anticipate their turns by observing their movement and immediately matching their roll direction.
2.  **Pitch and Angle of Attack:** After rolling into a turn, you'll need to pull the yoke back slightly to maintain altitude and keep the enemy centered vertically. However, avoid excessive pull; if you hear the stall warning horn – that's the alert that your wings are losing lift – immediately relax some back pressure on the yoke to decrease your Angle of Attack. The Angle of Attack (AoA) is simply the angle between your wing and the oncoming air; too high an AoA, and your wing stops producing lift, resulting in a stall.
3.  **Coordination (Sideslip):** You experienced significant sideslip angles, which means your turns were uncoordinated. Sideslip is when the aircraft's nose isn't perfectly aligned with its flight path, like skidding or slipping. To correct this, you need to use the rudder pedals. In a turn, apply rudder in the same direction you are rolling (e.g., right rudder for a right turn) to keep the ball centered on the G1000's slip/skid indicator. This ensures smooth, efficient turns.
4.  **Throttle Management:** Your throttle remained constant throughout the flight. To maintain tracking distance, you'll need to adjust your throttle. If the enemy is pulling away (distance increasing), increase throttle by pushing the throttle lever forward to gain speed. If you're getting too close, reduce throttle by pulling the lever back to slow down. KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed) on your G1000 will tell you your current speed.
5.  **Smooth Control Inputs:** Your inputs were quite large and abrupt after losing the enemy. Practice making smaller, smoother adjustments to the yoke for both pitch and roll, and integrate rudder use for coordinated flight. This will help you maintain a more stable platform for tracking.

You've got the basics, now let's refine those control inputs and get you locked onto that target! We'll work on this together next time.

Alright, that was your first real flight tracking an enemy, and it's a huge step! You kept the aircraft flying and didn't crash, which is excellent for a first-time experience. Let's break down the data.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal tracking position by precisely coordinating pitch, roll, and power inputs.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control throughout the flight, which is excellent. However, the data shows you consistently lost sight of the enemy in both pitch and heading, causing the distance to increase significantly. We also saw multiple stall warnings, indicating you exceeded the critical angle of attack without proper energy management.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to actively manage your throttle and coordinate your turns. When the enemy initiates a turn, immediately advance your throttle to full power (all the way forward) to maintain airspeed and tighten your turn radius. Simultaneously, apply coordinated rudder input with your ailerons to keep the slip-skid indicator – that's the little 'ball' on your G1000 Primary Flight Display – centered. This ensures efficient turns and prevents you from slipping or skidding, which wastes energy and makes tracking harder. Avoid excessive back pressure on the yoke, especially in turns, to prevent stall warnings. We'll work on this next time.

Alright, cadet, first time in a real aircraft, and you're already tackling enemy tracking! That's impressive. I want to acknowledge your persistence throughout this flight; you kept trying to regain the target, and importantly, you brought the aircraft back safely. That's a solid foundation to build upon.

Here's your debrief:

**What are my goals?**
To consistently track the enemy by maintaining visual contact, executing coordinated turns, and managing airspeed to avoid stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You showed persistence, but struggled with coordinated control during the enemy's turn, leading to extreme attitudes, airspeed fluctuations, and multiple stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on mastering smooth, coordinated turns with proper energy management: as the enemy begins a maneuver, smoothly apply appropriate aileron input in the direction of the turn, simultaneously adding just enough rudder to keep the 'slip/skid ball' (the black ball on the inclinometer within your G1000 Primary Flight Display) centered. Keeping that ball centered ensures you're not 'slipping' or 'skidding,' which means your aircraft isn't moving sideways through the air, causing unnecessary drag. As you roll into the turn, gently increase back pressure on the center stick to maintain your desired turn rate and prevent losing altitude, while simultaneously advancing the throttle to maintain your airspeed and prevent activating the stall warning. Remember, the stall warning indicates your wing is approaching an Angle of Attack (AoA) where it will stop producing sufficient lift, so maintaining adequate airspeed with throttle is critical during turns.

Alright, let's break down that flight. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed on your first real flight, especially when trying to track a moving target. You stepped into a cockpit, took the controls, and didn't crash – that's a huge win and shows you have excellent foundational composure!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy, minimizing distance and achieving smooth, coordinated flight.

**How am I doing?**
You did a great job maintaining initial control and avoiding a crash, which is paramount for a first flight. However, when the enemy aircraft initiated its right turn, you rapidly lost visual contact, indicated by your large heading and pitch deviations. Your distance from the enemy grew significantly, and you frequently activated the stall warning, showing uncoordinated flight and critically low airspeed during the critical phase of the manoeuvre.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must refine your fundamental aircraft control by focusing on coordinated stick and throttle management. When the enemy initiates a turn, immediately roll *into* their turn using the center stick (e.g., push the stick right for a right turn), simultaneously applying the correct rudder to keep the slip/skid ball on the G1000's primary flight display centered. The slip/skid ball is like a level bubble; if the ball is to the left, press the left rudder pedal; if it's to the right, press the right rudder pedal. Crucially, as you turn, push the throttle forward to add power and maintain your airspeed (KIAS), preventing stalls and enabling tighter turns. Concurrently, manage your pitch with small, precise center stick inputs (pulling back to climb or pushing forward to descend) to avoid high angles of attack – the angle between your wing and the oncoming air – which triggered those stall warnings. This will help you keep the enemy centered vertically in your view.

Alright, trainee, welcome back! That was your first time tracking an enemy aircraft in a real plane, and it's a challenging task. You did a great job keeping the aircraft in the air and not crashing, especially during those moments when the stall warning activated. That shows you have a fundamental grasp of basic aircraft control, which is commendable for your first flight!

Here's your feedback:

**1. What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain optimal tracking position by precisely coordinating pitch, roll, and power to stay behind the enemy aircraft, avoiding stalls and excessive deviations.

**2. How am I doing?**
While you successfully kept the aircraft flying, your primary objective of maintaining a stable tracking position behind the enemy aircraft was not consistently met. Your distance from the target increased significantly, from 387m at the start of the enemy's right turn (around 4.38s) to over 650m by the end of it (around 15.39s), and continued to grow to over 9000m. This indicates you were unable to effectively match the enemy's turning radius or speed, leading to frequent "lost sight of enemy" indications for both pitch and heading deviation. Crucially, you experienced multiple stall warnings, for example, at 14.3s and 74.16s, indicating you were approaching or exceeding the wing's **critical angle of attack** – the point where the wing can no longer produce sufficient lift.

**3. How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to focus on smoother, coordinated control inputs and integrate power management. When the enemy aircraft began its right turn, your roll inputs were often large and sudden (e.g., -84.94 degrees at 14.3s) and you had significant **sideslip angles** (e.g., 8.91 degrees at 14.3s), indicating uncoordinated turns. For a coordinated turn, you must apply **aileron** (stick left/right) and **rudder** (foot pedals left/right) simultaneously. Imagine "stepping on the ball" on your G1000's slip/skid indicator – you want that little ball centered to ensure you're turning efficiently without **sideslip**, which is when the aircraft is moving somewhat sideways through the air. If the ball is to the right, push the right rudder pedal; if it's to the left, push the left rudder pedal. Additionally, your throttle remained constant; however, in a turn, you'll naturally lose **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed) due to increased drag. To maintain your speed and tighten your turn to stay with the enemy, you need to proactively **add throttle** (push the throttle lever forward) as you initiate and maintain your turn. If you hear the stall warning horn or feel the aircraft **buffet** (shake), immediately reduce your **angle of attack** (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) by pushing the stick slightly forward and adding power to regain airspeed.

Alright, Airman, that was your first time in the cockpit, and you did a fantastic job staying calm and keeping us in the air for the whole flight – that's a huge accomplishment! Your basic control inputs were there, which is exactly what we need to build on. Let's break down the tracking exercise.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, staying within effective engagement parameters.

**How am I doing?**
You started well, but when the enemy initiated its right turn, your aircraft consistently rolled left or failed to initiate a timely right turn, causing you to lose horizontal sight (your "heading deviation" was significant) and greatly increase distance from the target.

**How to improve?**
To dramatically improve your tracking, you must immediately match the enemy's turn direction by rolling into the turn, and simultaneously adjust your pitch and power to maintain visual contact and distance. When the enemy turns right, apply right stick pressure to roll your wings right. As you roll, gently pull back on the stick (the "centre stick pitch ratio") to maintain your Angle of Attack – that's the angle between your wing and the oncoming air, crucial for lift – and prevent the nose from dropping too low (which is why you were often too low in "pitch deviation" and got stall warnings). Simultaneously, push the throttle forward to increase engine RPM ("throttle ratio"), giving you the power needed to sustain the turn and prevent the distance from increasing. If the stall warning activates (a horn or light indicating dangerously low airspeed for your current Angle of Attack), immediately ease forward on the stick to reduce your Angle of Attack and add full power to regain airspeed. We'll work on coordinating these inputs – roll, pitch, and power – as one fluid action to keep that target squarely in your sights.

Alright, pilot, excellent work on your first tracking flight in the Skyhawk! It's a big step getting into a real aircraft, and you handled it well. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft within your gunsight by precisely coordinating pitch, roll, and power.

**How am I doing?**
You did well maintaining a stable flight path and airspeed during the initial straight-and-level portion of the flight, demonstrating solid foundational aircraft control. That's a great start!

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must proactively apply coordinated roll and power inputs: as the enemy begins its turn, roll the aircraft by pushing the center stick in the direction of their turn and use opposite rudder to keep the slip-skid ball centered. Simultaneously, advance the throttle to full power to maintain energy and close the distance, ensuring the target stays within your view.

---
**Key Terms Explained:**

*   **Center Stick**: This is the main control in front of you. Pushing it forward or backward controls your aircraft's **pitch** (nose up or down), and pushing it left or right controls your **roll** (how much your wings bank).
*   **Throttle**: The black lever to your right. Pushing it forward increases engine power and speed; pulling it back reduces power.
*   **Rudder Pedals**: The foot pedals on the floor. Pushing the left pedal moves the rudder left and makes the nose yaw left; pushing the right pedal does the opposite. They are essential for making **coordinated turns**.
*   **Coordinated Turn**: A smooth, balanced turn. When you bank with the center stick, you need to apply a little opposite rudder to keep the "slip-skid ball" (a small ball on your G1000 screen) centered. If the ball is off-center, it means you're slipping or skidding, which makes your turns less efficient and harder to track. Think "step on the ball" to center it.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA)**: This is the angle at which the wing meets the oncoming air. If your AoA gets too high, your wing can lose lift, which is called a **stall**.
*   **Stall Warning**: An alert (often an audible horn or a light) that tells you your aircraft is about to stall. You experienced this a few times, indicating you were pulling the nose up too aggressively without enough speed.
*   **KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed)**: Your speed shown on the G1000, measured in nautical miles per hour.
*   **Energy Management**: Skillfully using your throttle and pitch to control your aircraft's speed and altitude. To stay with a turning target, you often need to add power to maintain your speed and energy.
*   **Closure Rate**: How quickly the distance between your aircraft and the enemy is changing. If the distance is increasing rapidly (positive closure rate), you're falling behind.
*   **Gunsight / Visually Centered**: For this exercise, imagine a virtual aiming reticle. The goal is to keep the enemy aircraft precisely in the center of your view, both horizontally and vertically, like you're aiming at them.

Alright, Trainee Pilot, great work getting into the cockpit for your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed initially, but you've already taken the crucial first step. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to consistently maintain visual contact with the enemy aircraft by matching its maneuvers and keeping it centered in your field of view.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained stable and steady flight during the initial phase before the enemy started its turn, which is an excellent foundation for a first flight. However, once the enemy initiated its right turn, your immediate response was delayed, and you struggled to match its maneuver, leading to a rapid increase in distance and several stall warnings as you tried to recover.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to focus on immediate and coordinated control inputs. When the enemy aircraft begins a turn, your first action must be to **roll** your aircraft in the **same direction** as the enemy using the center stick's roll axis. For example, if the enemy turns right, push the stick to the right to roll your wings right. As you roll, simultaneously and gently **pull back** on the stick (pitch up) to keep the enemy in your field of view, but be very mindful of your airspeed (KIAS on your G1000) and Angle of Attack (AoA). If your airspeed drops too low or the stall warning sounds (a horn you'll hear), immediately ease off the back pressure on the stick to regain speed and avoid a stall, then smoothly re-engage your turn once you're safely flying again. Remember: Roll to turn, then pitch to hold sight.

Alright, Trainee, great job on your first real flight! It takes courage to step into the cockpit, and you handled the aircraft safely, which is always paramount.

**What are my goals?**
Maintain constant visual contact and close distance to the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You did an excellent job keeping the aircraft safe and avoiding a crash, which is a huge accomplishment for your first flight! However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy in both pitch (vertical aim) and heading (horizontal aim), and the distance between you consistently increased. Multiple stall warnings indicate you were pulling back too hard on the stick without enough power.

**How to improve?**
Your biggest area for improvement is throttle management. When the enemy begins its turn, immediately apply full throttle (push the throttle lever forward to 1.0) to maintain airspeed and energy. Coordinate this power with smooth, continuous roll inputs (moving the stick left/right) to match their turn, and gentle pitch adjustments (moving the stick forward/back) to keep them visually centered. If the stall warning activates, immediately push the stick forward to reduce your Angle of Attack (AoA – the angle of the wing to the airflow) and add full throttle to regain airspeed and control.

Alright, cadet, let's go over your first tracking flight. You did well not crashing – that's always job one!

**What are my goals?**
To maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy, precisely matching their maneuvers while smoothly managing your aircraft's energy.

**How am I doing?**
Excellent job on your first flight – no crash! However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy, especially during their right turn, due to over-controlling pitch (nose up/down) and heading (left/right). Your airspeed varied wildly, and you received several stall warnings (where airflow over wings reduces, threatening loss of lift).

**How to improve?**
When the enemy turns, immediately match their roll (wing tilt) by smoothly moving the stick right. Simultaneously, apply back pressure on the stick to maintain angle of attack (wing's bite into air). Critically, increase throttle to maintain airspeed and close distance. Use small, continuous adjustments, not large, jerky inputs. Remember, coordinated turns use both stick and rudder pedals to keep the turn smooth.

Alright, listen up, Lieutenant. First flight in a real bird, that's a big step! You did well staying airborne throughout the sortie, which is commendable for a first-timer. You also maintained a constant throttle setting, which is a good baseline.

**What are my goals?**
Maintain consistent visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, preventing stalls and managing distance.

**How am I doing?**
Excellent job staying airborne! You kept the throttle steady. However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy due to large pitch (nose up/down) and heading deviations. Your abrupt control inputs led to multiple stall warnings (aircraft losing lift) and increasing distance.

**How to improve?**
Focus on anticipating enemy movement. Apply smooth, small centre stick inputs. To correct pitch, gently push or pull. To correct heading, roll into the turn. Actively adjust throttle to manage airspeed and close distance, avoiding high Angle of Attack (AoA) that causes stalls.

Alright, Cadet, let's go over your performance. This is your first time in a real aircraft, and that's a big step. You kept the plane in the air, which is fundamental, so well done on that!

Before we dive into the feedback, let's clarify a few terms you'll hear today:
*   **Yoke:** In the Cessna 172, this is the control wheel you push/pull to control **pitch** (nose up/down) and turn left/right to control **roll** (wing tilt). The "centre stick" in your data refers to these yoke inputs.
*   **Throttle:** This lever controls engine power, directly affecting your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed), which is your speed in nautical miles per hour.
*   **Roll:** Tilting the aircraft's wings left or right to initiate a turn.
*   **Pitch:** Moving the aircraft's nose up or down.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** The angle at which the wing meets the oncoming air. If it gets too high, the wing can lose lift, leading to a stall.
*   **Stall warning:** An audible horn in the Cessna 172 that sounds when your AoA is too high, indicating you're close to a stall and need to reduce pitch or increase power.
*   **Pitch deviation:** How far your aircraft's nose is pointing vertically relative to the target. Positive means you're too high.
*   **Heading deviation:** How far your aircraft's nose is pointing horizontally relative to the target. Positive means you're too far right.

Now, for your performance feedback:

**What are my goals?**
- Maintain visual contact by accurately matching the enemy's flight path and manage your distance for effective tracking.

**How am I doing?**
- You showed good initial stability and kept the aircraft safely airborne, but you lost consistent tracking and increased your distance from the enemy once they began their manoeuvre.

**How can I improve?**
- When the enemy turns, immediately apply correct roll and pitch inputs on the yoke to match their manoeuvre, and adjust throttle to maintain speed and close distance.

Here is your feedback, pilot:

What are my goals?
- To maintain close visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively managing your flight controls and power.

How am I doing?
- You demonstrated initial control stability, but struggled to maintain close visual contact with the enemy during their turn.

How can I improve?
- To maintain energy and track the enemy effectively, you must proactively increase throttle (push the lever forward, aiming for full power) when initiating turns to avoid airspeed loss and stall warnings.

What are my goals?
- To maintain precise tracking of the enemy aircraft by consistently applying timely and appropriate flight control inputs, ensuring safe and stable flight.

How am I doing?
You maintained a constant throttle setting and commendably avoided crashing despite entering a stall. However, you were not actively controlling the aircraft for the initial 12 seconds of the flight, allowing significant deviations in your flight path relative to the enemy aircraft.

*   **Throttle setting:** This refers to the engine's power level, controlled by the throttle lever. A constant setting means you kept the engine power steady.
*   **Deviations:** These are differences between your aircraft's position/attitude and the desired position/attitude relative to the enemy aircraft. Large deviations mean you were far off target.
*   **Stall:** A condition where the wings can no longer generate enough lift to support the aircraft's weight, often indicated by a "stall warning."

How can I improve?
You need to anticipate and respond to the enemy aircraft's maneuvers with immediate and coordinated control inputs. Specifically, when the enemy initiated its right turn at around 4.5 seconds, you should have smoothly applied right **roll** input with the center stick to bank the aircraft, simultaneously applying right **rudder** (foot pedals) to keep the nose aligned, and adjusting **pitch** (center stick forward/back) to maintain altitude and speed, preventing large deviations and avoiding uncoordinated flight that can lead to a stall.

*   **Anticipate:** To foresee or expect what the enemy aircraft will do next.
*   **Coordinated control inputs:** This means using the ailerons (via the center stick for roll), rudder (foot pedals for yaw), and elevator (via the center stick for pitch) together smoothly to achieve a desired maneuver without slipping or skidding.
*   **Roll:** The motion of the aircraft rotating around its nose-to-tail axis, controlled by the ailerons via the center stick.
*   **Rudder:** A control surface on the vertical tail that controls the aircraft's yaw (the nose moving left or right), operated by foot pedals.
*   **Pitch:** The nose-up or nose-down attitude of the aircraft, controlled by the elevator via the center stick.

Alright, recruit, this is your first time in the cockpit, so let's break down this flight data. Remember, our goal is to become proficient at tracking, which means keeping that enemy aircraft in your sights at all times.

You did a good job maintaining a steady flight path before the enemy aircraft started its maneuver. That shows you can keep the aircraft stable. However, let's look at how we can sharpen your tracking skills.

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft by proactively adjusting your aircraft's roll and pitch to match its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained stable flight initially, but you delayed control inputs significantly when the enemy aircraft began its turn, quickly losing sight.

**How can I improve?**
When the enemy aircraft begins a right turn, immediately apply right aileron by moving the center stick to the right, and add back pressure by pulling the stick back to maintain sight.

**Explanation of terms:**
*   **Roll:** This is how your aircraft rotates around its nose-to-tail axis, like when you bank left or right. You control this with the **ailerons** by moving the **center stick left or right**.
*   **Pitch:** This is how your aircraft points its nose up or down, rotating around its wingtip-to-wingtip axis. You control this with the **elevator** by moving the **center stick forward or back** (pushing or pulling).
*   **Aileron:** Control surfaces on the outer part of the wings that cause the aircraft to roll.
*   **Back pressure:** Pulling the center stick back towards you, which pitches the nose of the aircraft up. This is crucial in a turn to prevent losing altitude and to keep the target in view.
*   **Center stick pitch ratio/roll ratio:** These numbers tell us how much you're moving the stick. A `0.0` means no input, while a `1.0` means you're pushing/pulling or moving the stick all the way to its limit.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** This is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air. If it gets too high, your wing can stop producing lift, which is a **stall**.
*   **Stall Warning:** An alarm that tells you your wing is about to stall. You want to avoid this unless specifically instructed for a maneuver.
*   **KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed):** Your speed as shown on the airspeed indicator in the cockpit.

Keep up the good work! We'll practice reacting quicker to those enemy maneuvers next time. You've got this.

Alright, Lieutenant, let's go over your first tracking flight. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed on your first time in a real aircraft, especially with an enemy on the loose! You did well to stay calm and avoid a crash, which is always the priority.

Here's your debrief:

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain constant visual contact and optimal tracking distance to the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good initial stability before the enemy aircraft started its maneuver. However, once the enemy initiated its right turn, you quickly lost sight of the target, and your distance increased dramatically. This was compounded by experiencing a stall warning and achieving an extreme, inverted bank angle, indicating a significant loss of control and energy during the maneuver.

**How to improve?**
To improve, your immediate focus must be on executing a timely and coordinated turn by simultaneously applying *right aileron* and *back pressure* on the *centre stick*, while also advancing the *throttle* to full power. When the enemy aircraft begins its right turn, immediately push your centre stick to the right to input *right aileron*, causing your aircraft to *bank* (tilt sideways) to the right. Simultaneously, gently pull the centre stick back (apply *back pressure*) to increase your *angle of attack* and maintain lift for the turn, but be careful not to pull too hard and induce a *stall*. Crucially, you must also immediately advance the *throttle* to full power (1.0 ratio) as soon as the enemy begins its turn to maintain your airspeed, which is critical for energy management and preventing stall warnings.

*   **Aileron:** These are control surfaces on the trailing edge of your wings that cause the aircraft to roll or bank. Pushing the stick right applies right aileron, making the right wing go down.
*   **Bank:** This is the angle at which your aircraft tilts sideways during a turn. A right bank means your right wing is lower than your left.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** This is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air. Pulling back on the stick increases your AoA, which generates more lift for turning, but too much can lead to a stall.
*   **Stall:** This is when the airflow over your wings is disrupted, and they can no longer generate enough lift to support the aircraft. The stall warning horn indicates you are approaching this critical condition.
*   **Throttle:** This lever controls your engine's power. Advancing it forward increases power.

Next time, let's work on getting those coordinated turn inputs in early and smoothly. You've got this, Lieutenant!

Alright, Trainee Pilot, excellent work on your first real flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed, but you've taken a significant step, and I'm here to help you refine your skills.

Here's your feedback from this tracking exercise:

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively controlling your aircraft's position, speed, and energy.

**How am I doing?**
You did very well in maintaining control of the aircraft throughout the flight and, crucially, you did not crash, which is a fantastic achievement for your first time in a real plane! Your initial flight control before the enemy aircraft initiated its manoeuvre was also good, showing a steady hand. However, once the enemy began its turn, you rapidly lost visual contact and fell significantly behind, indicating a challenge in adapting your flight path and energy to match the target's manoeuvre.

**How to improve?**
To maintain continuous visual contact and effectively track the enemy, you must actively manage your aircraft's energy through precise throttle control and coordinated turns. When the enemy initiates a turn, smoothly advance your **throttle** to a higher setting (e.g., 0.8 or full) to maintain sufficient **airspeed** (KIAS – Knots Indicated Airspeed, displayed on your G1000) for an effective turn. Simultaneously, use coordinated inputs with the **centre stick** (for **pitch** – nose up/down – and **roll** – tilting the wings, creating a **bank angle**) and **rudder pedals** (for yaw control, helping coordinate the turn) to establish a consistent bank angle and adjust your pitch to match the enemy's vertical movement, always keeping your **Angle of Attack** (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) out of the **stall warning** range.

Alright, Trainee, great job getting into the cockpit for your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed when the enemy starts maneuvering, but you're here to learn, and we'll get you squared away.

Let's go over your performance:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal tracking distance and continuous visual contact with the enemy, while ensuring safe aircraft control.

**How am I doing?**
Well done for consistently engaging with the controls and attempting to maneuver; however, during the enemy's turn, you struggled to maintain visual contact and optimal tracking distance, leading to frequent stall warnings and losing sight.

**How to improve?**
When the enemy initiates a turn, immediately advance your `throttle ratio` to maximum (1.0, full power) to maintain `KIAS` (Knots Indicated Airspeed - your speed relative to the air) and energy. Simultaneously, apply coordinated `centre stick roll` (moving the stick left/right to bank the aircraft) and `centre stick pitch` (pulling back on the stick to bring the nose around) to match the enemy's turn, while carefully managing your `angle of attack` (AoA - the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) to avoid `stall warnings` (an audible horn indicating potential loss of lift). If you hear the stall warning, immediately ease back pressure on the stick and apply full power to recover.

Alright, Cadet, excellent first flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed on your first time in a real aircraft, and you handled some challenging moments well. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain consistent visual contact and a stable tracking position behind the enemy aircraft, avoiding stalls and extreme maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained a good initial position relative to the enemy aircraft, demonstrating initial control stability. However, you struggled to maintain visual contact and close the distance as the enemy began maneuvering, leading to significant separation and multiple stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To dramatically improve your tracking, anticipate the enemy's maneuvers and immediately initiate a coordinated turn in the *same direction*. When the enemy starts turning right (as it did around the 4.59-second mark), use right aileron (turn the **yoke** right) and right rudder (push the right **rudder pedal**) to bank right and align with its turn. Simultaneously, smoothly increase **throttle** (push the throttle lever forward) to maintain your **airspeed (KIAS)** and tighten your turn radius, avoiding excessive pitch up with the yoke to prevent **stalls**. A **coordinated turn** means using both the yoke and rudder pedals together to turn smoothly without slipping or skidding. Increasing throttle provides more power, which is essential to maintain airspeed and prevent a stall (when the wing loses lift due to too high an **Angle of Attack**).

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your first flight. It's a big step to be in a real aircraft, and I commend you for taking on this challenge.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain sight of the enemy and control your aircraft's energy state effectively, preventing stalls and maintaining safe flight.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained a good initial flight path and avoided a crash despite challenging conditions, which is commendable for a first flight. However, you struggled significantly with tracking the enemy during its turn, losing sight and experiencing repeated stall warnings due to inappropriate control inputs and power management.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must master **coordinated turns** and **energy management**. When the enemy turns, immediately apply **aileron input** (moving your center stick in the direction of the turn) to bank the aircraft, simultaneously using **rudder pedals** to keep the turn smooth and prevent adverse yaw (the tendency for the nose to initially move opposite the turn). As you bank and apply back pressure (pulling the stick back) to maintain altitude, **increase your throttle** (push the throttle lever forward) to maintain airspeed and prevent your **Angle of Attack** (AoA – the angle of your wing relative to the airflow) from becoming too high, which triggers a **stall warning** (an audible horn indicating loss of lift). Focus on smooth, continuous control inputs to maintain close tracking and safe flight.

Alright, recruit, great job on your first flight in the Skyhawk! It takes real courage to get in the cockpit for the first time, and you handled the aircraft safely, which is always our top priority. You didn't crash, and you maintained basic control throughout the flight, which is a fantastic starting point.

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to consistently maintain close visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively managing your aircraft's energy and position.

**How am I doing?**
You did an excellent job maintaining control of the aircraft throughout the flight, which is crucial for a first-time pilot. However, you consistently lost significant distance from the enemy, as shown by the rapidly increasing `distance` and `rate of change of distance` values, frequently losing visual contact.

**How to improve?**
To improve tracking, you must actively manage your throttle. The throttle controls your engine's power, which directly affects your airspeed (your speed through the air) and available energy (your ability to accelerate or climb). When the enemy pulls away or maneuvers, you need to **increase your throttle, potentially to full power**, to accelerate and regain speed. This will give you the energy needed to close the distance and execute turns more effectively, helping you avoid high `angle of attack` (which can lead to stall warnings) and maintain visual contact.

Welcome back! That was a great first attempt at tracking the enemy aircraft, and it's completely normal to find this challenging initially. Let's review your flight and set some clear goals for next time.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft by smoothly coordinating pitch and roll, while maintaining safe flight parameters.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained good initial alignment, but your control inputs became uncoordinated and extreme during the enemy's turn, leading to prolonged stall warnings and losing sight of the target.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on making proactive, gentle, and coordinated control inputs. When the enemy turns, smoothly apply the centre stick to roll the wings into the turn, *simultaneously* pressing the rudder pedal in the same direction to keep the turn coordinated (keep the "ball" centered on your G1000's slip/skid indicator). The rudder pedals control yaw, helping you turn efficiently without slipping or skidding. Crucially, add power with the throttle as needed to maintain your airspeed (Knots Indicated Airspeed, KIAS) and avoid excessive back pressure on the stick. Excessive back pressure increases your angle of attack (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) and can lead to a dangerous stall (when the wing loses lift), indicated by the warning horn. You've got this, and with practice, these smooth, coordinated inputs will become second nature!

Alright, Trainee Pilot, great work on your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed; flying a real aircraft is a big step, and you're doing well just getting off the ground. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft within your visual sight picture by skillfully coordinating your aircraft's controls.

**How am I doing?**
You did a good job maintaining a stable airspeed and avoiding stall warnings during the initial phase before the enemy started maneuvering. However, once the enemy aircraft began its right turn around the 4.59-second mark, you did not initiate a corresponding right bank, causing the distance to rapidly increase (from 388 meters to over 589 meters by 14.5 seconds), and you quickly lost sight of the target.

**How to improve?**
Focus on immediately applying **coordinated turns with appropriate power management** when the enemy maneuvers.
1.  **Add Power:** As soon as the enemy begins to turn, push your throttle forward to increase power (aim for 0.8 to 1.0 ratio, meaning 80% to full power). This is crucial for maintaining your speed and energy during the turn.
2.  **Initiate Bank:** Simultaneously, use your center stick to roll the aircraft into the turn. Since the enemy turned right, you should push the stick to the **right**. Aim for a moderate bank angle, typically 20-30 degrees. *Roll* is the rotation of the aircraft around its nose-to-tail axis; a positive roll means banking right.
3.  **Control Pitch (Angle of Attack):** As you bank, the nose will naturally want to drop. Apply *slight* back pressure on the center stick to maintain your altitude and keep the enemy in your vertical sight. Be cautious not to pull too hard, as indicated by your high *Angle of Attack* (AoA) readings (e.g., 17.22 degrees at 13.54 seconds) and the *stall warning* activating. The *Angle of Attack* is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air; too high an AoA can cause the wing to lose lift. If you hear the stall warning, immediately ease back on your pitch input.
4.  **Continuous Adjustment:** Constantly observe the enemy's position and your aircraft's *KIAS* (Knots Indicated Airspeed – your speed in nautical miles per hour). Make small, smooth adjustments to your stick (for pitch and roll) and throttle to stay behind the target. Your *center stick pitch ratio* and *center stick roll ratio* indicate how much you're moving the stick, and we want to see smooth, proportionate inputs, not sudden full deflections.

Alright, let's break down your performance. You're doing great, keep it up!

**What are my goals?**

To maintain a good visual on the enemy, maneuvering and adjusting to stay behind them.

**How am I doing?**

You're doing well at maintaining a good heading deviation grade throughout the exercise.

**How to improve?**

You can improve by making smaller, more precise adjustments to the centre stick and throttle, especially when the enemy aircraft is maneuvering. This will help you keep the enemy aircraft in sight.

Alright, let's break down your performance. Keep up the great work, you're doing well!

**What are my goals?**

Maintain a steady heading and altitude while keeping the enemy aircraft in sight.

**How am I doing?**

You did well maintaining a good heading and altitude, and kept the enemy aircraft in your sights for a long time.

**How to improve?**

When the enemy aircraft initiates a turn, anticipate its movements by applying small, smooth control inputs to the centre stick and throttle to maintain your position.

Alright, Cadet, let's review your performance on this enemy tracking exercise. Overall, you're showing promise, but there's room for improvement. Remember, the goal is to maintain a consistent visual on the enemy aircraft.

**What are my goals?**
To maintain visual contact with the enemy aircraft and predict its movements to track it.

**How am I doing?**
You did well to maintain a good heading grade for the majority of the exercise.

**How to improve?**
Focus on smoothly adjusting your control inputs to keep the enemy aircraft centered in your view. This means making small, precise adjustments with the stick to correct for pitch and heading deviations, especially during the enemy's maneuvers.

Alright, trainee, let's break down your performance. Keep in mind that tracking enemy aircraft is about anticipating their maneuvers and staying in a position to engage.

**What are my goals?**

Maintain a good position relative to the enemy aircraft to track it, while anticipating its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**

Overall, you've shown improvement. You maintained "good" heading deviation and pitch deviation grades for a significant portion of the flight, indicating good tracking. However, the data shows you lost sight of the enemy multiple times.

**How to improve?**

Here's a detailed breakdown to help you improve:

*   **Initial Phase (0.0 - 4.59 seconds):**
    *   You did well maintaining a "good" heading deviation grade.
    *   The distance from the enemy aircraft increased, which may have led to the "might lose sight of enemy" notification. *Action:* Maintain the same heading and increase throttle to reduce the distance.
    *   *Action*: Use small, smooth control inputs to keep the enemy aircraft centered in your view.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Turning Right (4.59 - 12.92 seconds):**
    *   You lost sight of the enemy aircraft multiple times.
    *   The distance from the enemy aircraft increased, with the maximum distance being 505 metres. *Action*: Anticipate the turns of the enemy aircraft and smoothly input a roll to turn right.
    *   *Action*: Use throttle to maintain the same distance from the enemy aircraft.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Turning Right (12.92 - 14.53 seconds):**
    *   You lost sight of the enemy aircraft multiple times.
    *   *Action*: You may have over-corrected, leading to a large change in roll. Reduce roll inputs, focus on smooth tracking.
    *   *Action*: You went into a stall warning. Reduce your angle of attack (pitch down) and increase your airspeed.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Finished Manoeuvre (14.53 - 35.94 seconds):**
    *   You lost sight of the enemy aircraft multiple times.
    *   *Action*: You did well with good heading deviation and pitch deviation grades.
    *   *Action*: Continue practicing smooth inputs and anticipating the enemy aircraft's movements to keep it centered in your view.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Finished Manoeuvre (35.94 - 44.86 seconds):**
    *   You maintained a "good" heading deviation and pitch deviation grade.
    *   *Action*: Continue practicing smooth inputs.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Finished Manoeuvre (44.86 - 54.89 seconds):**
    *   You maintained a "good" heading deviation and pitch deviation grade.
    *   *Action*: You consistently kept the enemy aircraft in your view and maintained a good position.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Finished Manoeuvre (54.89 - 66.72 seconds):**
    *   You did well with good heading deviation and pitch deviation grades.
    *   *Action*: Continue practicing smooth inputs and anticipating the enemy aircraft's movements to keep it centered in your view.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Finished Manoeuvre (66.72 - 73.92 seconds):**
    *   You consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft.
    *   *Action*: Anticipate the enemy aircraft's movements and make small, smooth adjustments to maintain a good position.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Finished Manoeuvre (73.92 - 87.21 seconds):**
    *   You did well with good heading deviation and pitch deviation grades.
    *   *Action*: Continue practicing smooth inputs and anticipating the enemy aircraft's movements to keep it centered in your view.

*   **Enemy Aircraft Finished Manoeuvre (87.21 - 106.97 seconds):**
    *   You did well with good heading deviation and pitch deviation grades.
    *   *Action*: Continue practicing smooth inputs and anticipating the enemy aircraft's movements to keep it centered in your view.

Remember, tracking is about anticipating. Keep practicing, and you'll get there!

Alright, Trainee, great job on your first flight in the Cessna 172 SP! You maintained control of the aircraft throughout the sortie and avoided any dangerous situations. That's a crucial first step, and you handled the basic flight controls well.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and a consistent tracking position behind the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
While you safely operated the aircraft, you consistently lost sight of the enemy and fell significantly behind, especially during its turn, indicated by the rapidly increasing distance and frequent "lost sight" grades.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your **airspeed** and **turn rate** using coordinated control inputs. Your constant **throttle** setting of 0.5 (that's the black knob you push forward or pull back to control engine power) meant you couldn't keep up. When the enemy initiates a turn, immediately increase your throttle by pushing it forward to accelerate and close the distance. Simultaneously, apply **aileron** input (rotate the **yoke**, or 'steering wheel', left or right) to roll into the enemy's turn, matching their **roll angle**, and use the **elevator** (pushing or pulling the yoke) to adjust your **pitch** (nose up or down) to keep them centered in your windscreen. If the **stall warning** (the audible horn) sounds, immediately reduce elevator input by pushing the yoke forward slightly and add more throttle to regain **airspeed** before resuming the turn.

Alright, pilot, excellent job getting the Cessna airborne and maintaining initial control – that's a huge step for your first time! Let's review the data from your training flight.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain proper tracking distance and keep the enemy aircraft in sight, especially during their maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good initial aircraft control. However, you struggled to maintain tracking distance and visual contact, especially during the enemy's maneuver.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your throttle (engine power, like a car's accelerator). Push the throttle forward to increase engine power and gain speed, or pull it back to reduce power and slow down, using this to control your airspeed and maintain optimal tracking distance. Simultaneously, use small, precise pitch adjustments (moving the yoke forward or back) to control your Angle of Attack (AoA) – the angle your wing meets the oncoming air – ensuring it stays within safe limits to prevent stall warnings and maintain constant visual contact with the target.

Alright recruit, great job getting into the cockpit for your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but you've already taken a huge step. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to precisely maintain a consistent distance and visual track on the enemy aircraft by coordinating your aircraft's pitch, heading, and airspeed.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully maintained a position *behind* the enemy aircraft throughout the flight, which is an excellent foundational achievement for a tracking mission. However, you repeatedly lost visual contact with the target and significantly increased your distance from it, especially when the enemy aircraft began its turn.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must proactively manage your aircraft's energy by adjusting the **throttle** (the black lever on your left, controlling engine power) more dynamically. When the enemy aircraft turns or you notice your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed, displayed on your G1000 Primary Flight Display) dropping, smoothly advance the throttle forward to increase power and maintain or regain speed. Simultaneously, pay close attention to your **Angle of Attack** (AoA, the angle between your wing and the air, also displayed on the G1000). If your airspeed drops too low or the **stall warning** (an audible horn and a red light on your G1000) activates, gently push the control stick forward to lower your nose, which will reduce your AoA, then add more throttle to recover and regain speed to stay with the target.

Alright, Trainee, welcome to your first flight! That was a challenging initial run, but you handled the aircraft well and, most importantly, you didn't crash, which is a fantastic achievement for your very first time in a real plane. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain effective visual and positional tracking of the enemy aircraft by coordinating pitch, roll, and power.

**How am I doing?**
You did well maintaining aircraft control and avoiding a crash, demonstrating basic stick and rudder familiarity. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft after it began its turn, as indicated by the rapidly increasing distance and "lost sight of enemy" grades in your flight data.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you must actively manage your **throttle ratio** – which controls your engine power – to maintain airspeed and energy, especially during dynamic maneuvers. Your throttle remained at 0.5 (50% power) throughout the flight. When the enemy aircraft initiated its turn, you need to anticipate the need for more energy. To execute this:
1.  **Increase Power:** Push the throttle lever forward towards full power (1.0 ratio) *before* or simultaneously as you begin your turn. This provides the necessary thrust to maintain or increase your **KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed)** and energy.
2.  **Coordinate Controls:** As you increase power, smoothly apply appropriate **pitch** (pulling back on the yoke to climb or push forward to descend) and **roll** (turning the yoke left or right to bank the wings) inputs to match the enemy's turn. This will allow you to tighten your turn radius without bleeding off too much airspeed or increasing your **Angle of Attack (AoA)** – the angle between your wing and the oncoming air – to dangerous levels, which caused those stall warnings. By using more power, you'll be able to maintain safe airspeed and keep the target centered in your sight.

Alright, Trainee, settle in. That was your first time in a real aircraft, and you did well to maintain control and avoid a crash, which is excellent for a first flight! Let's break down this tracking exercise.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively managing your aircraft's position and energy.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good basic aircraft control and maintained stable flight before the enemy aircraft initiated its maneuver. However, you lost significant ground to the enemy aircraft during and after its turn, indicating difficulty maintaining range and relative position, as you consistently fell behind and lost sight of the target.

**How to improve?**
Your main area for improvement is dynamic power management. You kept the throttle, which controls your engine's power, at 0.5 (half power) throughout the entire flight, which is insufficient to keep pace with a maneuvering target. To effectively track the enemy, you must proactively adjust your throttle: as the enemy aircraft began its turn around the 4.5-second mark, you should have smoothly advanced your throttle towards full power (1.0 ratio). This increase in engine thrust provides the necessary energy to accelerate, reduce the distance to the target, and gives you more aerodynamic authority, helping you maintain a safe Angle of Attack (AoA) – the angle between your wing and the oncoming air – and avoid the stall warnings you experienced when you tried to pitch up too aggressively without enough power.

Alright, listen up, Lieutenant. That was your first time in a real aircraft, and that's a huge step! You kept the Cessna safely in the air for the entire flight, which is a fantastic achievement for your very first time at the controls. That consistency, especially with your `throttle` setting, shows a solid foundation.

Let's break down your performance:

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain precise control, anticipate enemy manoeuvres, and manage aircraft energy to stay on target.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully kept the aircraft safely in the air and maintained a consistent `throttle` setting throughout the flight, which shows good foundational control. However, your response to the enemy's manoeuvre was delayed, and when you did make inputs, they were often too large and abrupt. This led to high `Angle of Attack` (AoA) readings and `stall warnings`, causing you to quickly lose sight of the target.

*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** This is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air. Think of it like how much your wing is biting into the air to produce lift. If the AoA gets too high, the wing can't produce enough lift, and the aircraft will `stall`.
*   **Stall Warning:** This is an audible horn and often a buffeting sensation you felt, telling you that your wing is approaching its `critical angle of attack` and is about to `stall`. A `stall` is when the airflow over the wing separates, and the wing stops producing lift, making it difficult to control the aircraft.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on making small, smooth, and continuous adjustments with your `centre stick` for `pitch` (nose up/down) and `roll` (wing tilt), and actively manage your `throttle` (engine power setting) to control your `kias` (Knots Indicated Airspeed). This means as soon as you observe the target moving or your distance changing, make subtle corrections: for `pitch`, gently push the `centre stick` forward to lower the nose or pull it back to raise the nose, aiming to keep the target vertically centered in your view; for `roll`, gently move the `centre stick` left or right to tilt the wings, which will turn the aircraft to horizontally center the target. Simultaneously, adjust your `throttle` proactively: push the `throttle` lever forward to increase power and speed up if you're falling behind and the distance to the enemy is increasing, or pull it back to reduce power and slow down if you're getting too close and the distance is decreasing. The key is to make these control inputs in a coordinated, fluid manner, like guiding the aircraft with your fingertips, rather than sudden, large movements after a significant deviation.

Alright recruit, great job getting into the air and taking the stick for the first time! That's a huge step, and it's completely normal for your first flight to be a learning experience. You showed good basic aircraft control in the initial phase, maintaining stability before the enemy initiated its maneuver. More importantly, you maintained control and didn't crash, even when faced with significant deviations and stall warnings, which shows excellent resilience and a willingness to learn. Now let's refine those tracking skills.

**1. What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft precisely centered in your view, both vertically and horizontally, by applying timely and smooth flight control inputs.

**2. How am I doing?**
You struggled significantly to maintain the enemy aircraft within your visual field, particularly during and after its turn, leading to consistent 'lost sight of enemy' ratings and a large, ever-increasing distance from the target.

**3. How to improve?**
To improve, focus on integrating **coordinated flight controls and active throttle management**. When the enemy initiates a turn, you need to react immediately. Promptly apply **gentle center stick roll** in the same direction as the enemy's bank angle to match their turn. Simultaneously, use your **rudder pedals** – those foot controls on the floor – to keep the **slip-skid indicator's 'ball' centered** on your G1000 display. This 'ball' shows if you're slipping or skidding; keeping it centered ensures a smooth, efficient 'coordinated turn,' meaning your aircraft is flying straight through the relative wind. Critically, you must also **actively manage your throttle** (the lever next to your seat): increase power to speed up and close distance on the target, and decrease power to slow down and open distance. This constant adjustment of power is essential for maintaining your optimal tracking position.

Alright, trainee, let's go over your performance from this tracking exercise. You did a solid job maintaining aircraft stability throughout the flight, which is excellent for your first time in the simulator. Not crashing is always a win, so well done there! You also showed good initial control before the enemy aircraft began its maneuver. Now, let's refine your technique.

### What are my goals?
Your primary goal is to maintain precise relative position to the enemy by actively managing your energy and flight path.

### How am I doing?
Excellent job maintaining stable flight without crashing, which is a great start for your first simulator session! While you initially kept the enemy in sight, your primary challenge was maintaining effective tracking during the enemy's turn, leading to a significant increase in `distance` and frequently `losing sight of the enemy` due to large `heading deviation` (turning too slowly to the left) and `pitch deviation`. This was largely due to not adjusting your `throttle ratio` (engine power percentage), which resulted in multiple `stall warnings` (an alert indicating your wing is losing lift due to a high `angle of attack` for your `KIAS`).

### How to improve?
To improve, you must actively manage your `throttle ratio` (engine power) to maintain appropriate airspeed and energy for tracking. When the enemy initiates a turn, immediately increase your `throttle ratio` by smoothly pushing the throttle forward. This will increase your `KIAS` (Knots Indicated Airspeed) and allow you to maintain sufficient `angle of attack` (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) without encountering a `stall warning`. Continuously adjust the throttle as needed throughout the maneuver to maintain optimal airspeed, increasing power when you need more lift or tighter turns, and reducing it if you're gaining too much distance. If you hear a `stall warning`, push the throttle forward decisively and ease back slightly on the `centre stick` to lower your `angle of attack` and regain airspeed, then re-engage your turn.

Alright, Trainee! Welcome to the cockpit. It's great to have you in the simulator, and your commitment to learning is clear. Let's break down your flight data and get you set for success.

**What are my goals?**
Your goals are to maintain constant visual contact, manage airspeed effectively, and execute precise control inputs for tracking.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully avoided a crash, which is commendable for a first flight, and showed good initial control before the enemy maneuver. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy due to significant airspeed decay, multiple stall warnings, and large pitch and heading deviations, especially when the enemy initiated maneuvers.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your **throttle ratio** (engine power) in coordination with your **pitch** (nose up/down attitude) to maintain appropriate **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed) for tracking. Your current fixed throttle setting is causing you to lose speed and subsequently fall behind and stall. When the enemy maneuvers, you need more power to maintain your speed and turn effectively. As you turn, the wings generate more lift but also more drag, which slows you down. To counteract this, increase your throttle. For example, if you notice your KIAS dropping below 85 knots or the enemy pulling away, immediately increase your throttle by pushing it forward. Simultaneously, use small, smooth inputs on the **center stick** to control your pitch and avoid excessively high **angle of attack** (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air), which can cause a **stall** (loss of lift due to exceeding the wing's critical angle of attack), as indicated by the stall warning. Maintain a stable AoA, typically 3-5 degrees, adjusting power to maintain speed.

Alright recruit, great job getting through your first simulator flight without crashing! That's a crucial first step, and you handled the aircraft's basic stability well. Let's break down this training flight.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain close visual contact with the enemy aircraft and prevent it from opening distance.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control without crashing, which is excellent for a first flight. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft and fell significantly behind, indicating a need to maintain position.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your power and coordinate your stick inputs. The constant throttle at 0.5 was insufficient to keep up. When the enemy begins a maneuver, *immediately* push the throttle lever forward (to increase engine power) to maintain airspeed (KIAS) and closure (prevent distance from increasing). Simultaneously, smoothly apply coordinated stick input: roll the center stick in the direction of the enemy's turn (e.g., right for a right turn) and apply appropriate *back pressure* on the stick (pulling it back) to increase your aircraft's pitch (nose up) and turn rate. This combination will allow you to match the enemy's energy and turn, keeping it visually centered. The stall warnings you experienced were likely due to pulling back on the stick too hard without enough throttle, which slows the aircraft down too much and can lead to a stall if unchecked.

Alright, Trainee, great job getting into the simulator and taking on this challenge! Flying a real plane is a big step, and you handled it safely, which is always the top priority. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and optimal tracking distance with the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You did a fantastic job avoiding a crash, which is always paramount, demonstrating good basic control! However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy and fell significantly behind, especially during and after their turn, which indicates a primary area for improvement.

**How to improve?**
The main area for improvement is your **throttle control**. You kept the throttle at a constant 0.5 ratio throughout the entire flight. In aviation, the **throttle** controls engine power, which directly affects your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed) – your speed relative to the air. By not adjusting power, you couldn't maintain the necessary energy to keep up with the enemy, causing you to fall further behind and experience multiple **stall warnings** (an alert indicating your **Angle of Attack**, the angle of your wing to the airflow, is too high, risking loss of lift). To improve, actively manage your throttle: **increase throttle (push the throttle lever forward)** when you need more speed to close the distance or maintain energy in a turn. Conversely, **reduce throttle (pull the throttle lever back)** if you are getting too close or need to slow down. Simultaneously, use small, precise inputs on the **centre stick** to refine your **pitch** (nose up/down) and **heading** (direction of flight) to stay aligned with the enemy. If the enemy turns right, smoothly roll right with the centre stick to match their turn, then adjust your pitch with careful stick movements to keep them centered vertically.

Alright, Trainee, great job on your first flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but you're already demonstrating good fundamental control by keeping the aircraft safe and avoiding a crash. That's always the number one priority, so well done there.

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain close visual contact with the enemy, especially during maneuvers, while safely managing your aircraft's energy.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained basic control and avoided a crash, which is excellent for a first flight. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy during its right turn, and the stall warning activated, indicating you were losing too much airspeed while trying to turn. The stall warning is an audible alert indicating your wings are losing lift, often due to insufficient airspeed for your current Angle of Attack (AoA), which is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air.

**How to improve?**
When the enemy initiates a turn, you need to actively manage your energy. Push the throttle forward to increase engine power and prevent your KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed) from dropping, which is your speed through the air. Simultaneously, increase your bank angle by smoothly moving the centre stick to the right to roll into a steeper turn, and apply coordinated back pressure on the stick to tighten your turn and match the enemy's maneuver. Remember to use your rudder pedals to keep the turn smooth and efficient, preventing any slip or skid. This combination of increased power, bank, and coordinated back pressure will help you maintain airspeed and stay on target.

Alright, pilot, let's go over your performance from this tracking exercise. You did a great job maintaining control of the aircraft throughout the flight and avoiding a crash, which is excellent for your first time flying a real plane. That's a crucial first step!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy aircraft and control your distance effectively throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained aircraft control and avoided a crash, an excellent first flight. However, you consistently lost visual contact, and your distance from the enemy increased significantly.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your throttle during enemy maneuvers. When the enemy begins its turn, smoothly advance the throttle forward while simultaneously pulling back on the centre stick to tighten your own turn. This added power directly combats the drag generated by turning, allowing you to maintain your airspeed (Knots Indicated Airspeed, or KIAS, visible on your G1000 display) and 'energy' for effective pursuit. Failing to add power during turns, as evidenced by your repeated stall warnings, leads to significant airspeed loss and makes it impossible to maintain position.

Alright, Trainee, welcome to your first simulator flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but you're doing great just by getting in the cockpit. Let's look at your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft, keeping it centered in your field of view throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
For your first time, you did well maintaining control of the aircraft and didn't crash, which is a fantastic start! However, you consistently lost visual contact with the enemy, especially when it began its turn, leading to significant separation.

**How to improve?**
You need to actively manage your airspeed and energy by using the throttle. When the enemy aircraft initiates a turn, immediately advance your throttle to full power (100%) to provide the necessary thrust. This will help you maintain your speed, tighten your turn radius, and prevent the enemy from out-maneuvering you and disappearing from sight. Remember, the "throttle" is the lever that controls engine power and thus your speed.

Alright, Trainee Pilot, excellent work on your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to face challenges when first getting the feel for a real aircraft, especially with dynamic targets. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal tracking parameters (distance, pitch, heading) to stay precisely behind the enemy aircraft, avoiding stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained stable flight before the enemy aircraft began its maneuver, which is excellent for a first flight. However, once the enemy aircraft initiated its turn, you consistently fell behind and unfortunately lost sight of the target.

**How to improve?**
To maintain tracking, you need to actively manage your engine power using the **throttle**. The throttle controls engine power; increasing it provides more thrust, allowing you to accelerate, climb, or maintain airspeed in a turn. When the enemy aircraft begins its turn, immediately increase your throttle (e.g., to 0.8 or even full power) to maintain your airspeed (**KIAS** – Knots Indicated Airspeed, displayed on the G1000's Primary Flight Display or PFD) and prevent the distance from increasing. This power adjustment is crucial for performing tighter turns without reaching a high **Angle of Attack (AoA)**, which is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air, and avoiding the **stall warning** (the horn indicating your wing is losing lift). Constantly monitor your KIAS and adjust power as needed, coordinating these throttle inputs with your centre stick movements for pitch and heading.

Alright, Cadet, excellent job staying calm and avoiding any critical errors during your first enemy tracking sortie! That's a crucial first step, especially as you navigate a new aircraft and simulator environment.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain consistent range and relative position to the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control and avoided a crash, which is commendable for a first flight. However, you struggled significantly with range management, consistently falling far behind the enemy due to a fixed throttle setting.

**How to improve?**
To improve, actively manage your throttle for precise range control. When the enemy pulls away and your distance increases, push the throttle lever, located on your left, forward to increase power and close the gap. If you find yourself getting too close or needing to slow down for a turn, pull the throttle back to reduce power. This dynamic use of power is essential for maintaining your tracking position.

Alright, future aviator! That was your first crack at tracking, and I'm here to help you refine those skills. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain precise visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, minimizing deviations and ensuring safe, stable flight.

**How am I doing?**
First, well done on keeping the aircraft safely airborne throughout the flight, avoiding a crash, and always remaining behind the enemy. However, your tracking precision, especially during the enemy's right turn, showed significant deviations in both pitch (vertical aiming) and heading (horizontal aiming), causing you to fall far behind. You also encountered multiple stall warnings, indicating that your angle of attack was too high at times.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on **coordinated turns with precise energy management**. When the enemy begins a turn, smoothly apply *bank* (tilting the wings) with the centre stick. Simultaneously, use the rudder pedals – apply rudder in the *same direction as your turn* – to keep the *slip/skid indicator's 'ball' centered* on your G1000, which indicates a coordinated turn. Crucially, add power with the throttle *before and during* the turn to maintain your airspeed (KIAS, or Knots Indicated Airspeed) and prevent it from dropping too low. This proactive speed management will prevent stall warnings and allow you to maintain proximity and track the enemy more effectively.

Alright, recruit, excellent job on your first simulator flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed initially, but you've demonstrated good fundamental aircraft control by successfully avoiding any crashes. That's a crucial first step!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal tracking position (distance, pitch, heading) and airspeed through precise control inputs.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained basic aircraft control throughout the flight, which is commendable for your first time, but you consistently fell behind the enemy aircraft.

**How to improve?**
Your main area for improvement is actively managing your **throttle** to control your **airspeed (KIAS)** and maintain your **distance** to the enemy. You kept the throttle at a constant 0.5 ratio, which prevented you from catching up or staying with the target.

*   To **close the distance** when falling behind, you need to **increase your throttle ratio** (push the throttle lever forward) to gain speed and accelerate towards the target.
*   Remember, **pitch (controlled by your centre stick)** primarily controls your **Angle of Attack (AoA)** and affects your rate of climb or descent, while **throttle** primarily controls your **airspeed**. When you need to pitch up (pull back on the stick) to correct **pitch deviation** or turn, you must simultaneously **add throttle** to maintain sufficient airspeed and prevent a stall warning, which indicates your wing is losing lift. Think of throttle and pitch as a team: use throttle to manage speed and pitch to manage your vertical path, always ensuring you have enough power to support your desired maneuver.

Alright, Cadet, let's look at your performance on this tracking exercise. It's your first time in a real aircraft simulator, so remember, this is all about learning and building muscle memory. You did well in keeping the aircraft under control and avoiding a crash, which is always our top priority!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain the enemy aircraft within visual range by minimizing angular deviations and to ensure safe flight by avoiding stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control and avoided a crash, which is excellent, and your initial flight segment was stable. However, during and after the enemy's right turn, your heading deviation became excessive, indicating you lost horizontal tracking, and you frequently triggered the stall warning, indicating your angle of attack (AoA) was too high, leading to a loss of lift. The **Angle of Attack (AoA)** is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air; if it gets too steep for your airspeed, the wing can stop producing enough lift, which is called a **stall**.

**How to improve?**
To prevent future stall warnings, which occur when your wing's **Angle of Attack (AoA)** becomes too high and loses lift, immediately ease the **centre stick** (your primary flight control for pitch and roll) forward to reduce AoA and simultaneously apply more **throttle** (engine power) to regain airspeed. For effective tracking during turns, use **coordinated inputs**: bank with aileron and apply rudder in the same direction, keeping the "ball" centered on the turn coordinator, while managing your pitch with the centre stick and maintaining airspeed with the throttle. A **coordinated turn** means your aircraft isn't slipping (sliding sideways outwards) or skidding (sliding sideways inwards) during the turn.

Alright, Cadet, let's go over your performance. This was likely your first time in a real aircraft simulator, so it's understandable to feel a bit overwhelmed. You did well to keep the aircraft from crashing despite some challenging situations, which shows good basic instincts for recovery. That's a critical foundation!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy, precisely controlling pitch and heading, while managing airspeed and power to avoid stalls and stay close.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully avoided a crash despite multiple stall warnings, which demonstrates good basic aircraft recovery instincts. However, your primary challenge was maintaining effective tracking during and after the enemy's maneuver. Your pitch and heading deviations were consistently large, frequently causing the enemy aircraft to move out of your visual range, and the distance between you and the target significantly increased.

**How to improve?**
Your key area for improvement is **active throttle management**. You maintained a constant throttle setting of 0.5 throughout the flight. When maneuvering, especially during turns to track an enemy, you must **increase throttle** (push the throttle lever forward) to generate more power. This added power compensates for increased drag in turns and helps maintain your airspeed and energy, preventing the high angles of attack (AoA) that triggered your numerous stall warnings. Remember, AoA is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air; too high, and your wing can stall. Simultaneously, focus on making **smaller, smoother, and more coordinated stick inputs**, using your rudder pedals to keep the slip/skid indicator (the 'ball') centered on the G1000 display. This coordination is vital for efficient turns and precise tracking.

Alright recruit, great job on your first simulator flight! It takes courage to get in the cockpit, even in a simulator, and you handled the aircraft safely, avoiding any crashes and maintaining a generally safe altitude throughout the flight. That's a solid foundation.

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft within your view and control parameters, keeping it consistently tracked.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained a safe altitude and avoided crashing, which is excellent for a first flight. However, you struggled significantly to maintain visual contact with the enemy aircraft, especially after it initiated its turn, leading to large deviations and frequent stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your aircraft's energy by adjusting the throttle to maintain airspeed during maneuvers and coordinate your turns effectively. When the enemy aircraft begins its turn, you need to *immediately* increase your throttle significantly, likely to full power (1.0 ratio), to prevent significant speed loss and avoid those stall warnings you experienced. Simultaneously, use your centre stick for bank (rolling the wings) and pitch (moving the nose up or down to control your airspeed), and apply appropriate rudder with your foot pedals to keep the slip/skid indicator (the 'ball' on your G1000 Primary Flight Display, or PFD) centered for a smooth, efficient turn. Remember: pitch controls airspeed, power controls altitude, and coordinated rudder and aileron inputs are key for effective turning.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance on this tracking sortie. This is your first time in a real plane, and you're already tackling complex tasks. That's a great start!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain constant visual contact and close proximity, anticipating enemy maneuvers to stay centered.

**How am I doing?**
You did well avoiding a crash, which is paramount for safety. However, you frequently struggled to maintain consistent visual contact with the enemy, often losing sight due to large deviations in both pitch and heading.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your aircraft's energy by adjusting the throttle to maintain appropriate airspeed. When the enemy performs a maneuver, proactively increase throttle and use smooth, coordinated center stick and rudder pedal inputs to match their turn, keeping the target centered without entering a stall warning.

---

**Terminology Explained:**

*   **Throttle (Power):** This lever controls engine power, which dictates your airspeed and ability to climb or accelerate. Your throttle remained constant at 50% throughout the flight, which limited your ability to respond to the enemy's movements.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** This is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air. Too high an AoA can lead to a **stall**, where the wing stops producing lift, causing the aircraft to lose altitude rapidly. The **stall warning** indicates you're approaching this critical state.
*   **KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed):** This is your aircraft's speed as measured by the pitot-static system, displayed on your G1000.
*   **Pitch Deviation:** This tells you if you're pointing too high (positive value) or too low (negative value) relative to the target, impacting vertical tracking.
*   **Heading Deviation:** This tells you if you're pointing too far right (positive value) or left (negative value) relative to the target, impacting horizontal tracking.
*   **Coordinated Stick and Rudder Pedal Inputs:** "Coordinated inputs" means using the rudder pedals *with* your center stick to control turns. When you roll (move the stick left or right), you also need to apply rudder in the direction of the turn to prevent slipping or skidding, which can make your turns inefficient and lead to altitude loss or excessive drag.

Alright, cadet, excellent work keeping that simulator session going – no crashes, and you maintained a consistent throttle setting throughout! That's a great baseline for control.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to consistently maintain the enemy aircraft within your sight, controlling both distance and relative position.

**How am I doing?**
While you kept a steady throttle, during the enemy's right turn, your heading deviation grew significantly, indicating you were pointing far too left of the target, causing you to lose sight and fall rapidly behind. You also encountered multiple stall warnings, which happen when your Angle of Attack (AoA) gets too high (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air), typically from pulling back too hard on the centre stick.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to focus on coordinating your turns: when the enemy aircraft initiates a right turn, apply smooth, sufficient right rudder (using your right foot pedal to yaw the nose right) and right stick (tilting the centre stick right to roll the wings right) to initiate a coordinated right turn and center the target horizontally. Simultaneously, use gentle, coordinated back pressure on the stick to maintain your desired pitch (nose up/down attitude) and avoid those stall warnings.

Alright, let's go over your flight data from this enemy tracking exercise. This is your first time in a real plane, so great job keeping the aircraft flying; that's a fundamental success and shows excellent basic stick and rudder control.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a constant, close tracking position behind the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully kept the aircraft flying without crashing, which is excellent for your first real flight! However, you consistently fell significantly behind the enemy, struggled to maintain proper heading, and frequently encountered stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
The most critical improvement is active power management; you kept the throttle constant at 0.5. To maintain airspeed and enable tighter turns when tracking, push the black throttle lever forward to increase power when the enemy maneuvers, and consistently monitor your KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed) on the G1000's Primary Flight Display (PFD).

Alright, Trainee! First flight in the simulator, that's a big step, and you handled it without crashing, which is excellent. That shows you're getting a feel for the basic controls and maintaining aircraft integrity, a crucial first step!

Here's your performance breakdown:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are maintaining optimal tracking distance, zero pitch/heading deviation, and precise speed control using coordinated stick and throttle inputs.

**How am I doing?**
You showed good initial stability before the enemy maneuver began. However, your constant throttle setting prevented effective speed matching (your Knots Indicated Airspeed, or KIAS), causing the distance to increase significantly and leading to multiple stall warnings. A stall warning means your wing is approaching its critical Angle of Attack (AoA), where it loses lift, and your aircraft could fall out of the sky.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your throttle. Increase power to close distance and accelerate, and reduce power to create separation and decelerate. This directly controls your airspeed and tracking, allowing you to match the enemy's speed and maintain position. Remember, your centre stick controls pitch (nose up/down) and roll (wing tilt), while the throttle controls your speed. For effective tracking, you need to use both in a coordinated manner.

Alright, Trainee, let's break down your first simulated flight. This is where we learn, so don't be afraid to make mistakes. You’re doing great just by being here and putting in the effort.

First, let's clarify a couple of terms you'll encounter:
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** This is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air. If your AoA gets too high, your wing can lose lift, leading to a 'stall' – not a stopped engine, but a loss of aerodynamic lift. The stall warning is designed to alert you before this happens.
*   **KIAS:** Knots Indicated Airspeed, your speed through the air as shown on your instruments.

Now, let's get into your performance feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain close visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively managing your aircraft's energy and precise flight control.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated excellent airmanship by maintaining aircraft control and avoiding a crash, which is commendable for your first flight. However, you consistently fell far behind the enemy aircraft, resulting in losing sight due to large pitch and heading deviations and experiencing frequent stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, your primary focus must be active energy management using the throttle. Your fixed throttle ratio of 0.5 was insufficient to keep pace; you must smoothly advance the throttle towards full power (ratio 1.0) on the G1000's engine display when the enemy maneuvers or distance increases. This crucial adjustment will enable you to maintain airspeed and close the gap, which in turn will allow for more effective, precise adjustments with the center stick for pitch and roll, and proper use of your rudder pedals for coordinated turns to accurately center the target and avoid high Angle of Attack (AoA) stall warnings.

Alright, recruit, that was your first time in the cockpit, and you did well to keep the aircraft stable initially and avoid a crash. That's a solid foundation to build upon. Let's look at the data from this tracking exercise.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to precisely track the enemy aircraft, maintaining optimal distance and airspeed, while actively preventing any stall warnings.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good initial aircraft control and did not crash, which is commendable for your first real flight. However, during the enemy's right turn, you fell significantly behind, experienced multiple stall warnings, and struggled with heading alignment.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your aircraft's energy by adjusting the throttle. When the enemy turns or you start falling behind (as indicated by your `distance` and `rate of change of distance` increasing rapidly), smoothly increase your throttle (move the throttle lever forward) to gain `KIAS` (Knots Indicated Airspeed) and close the distance. This will provide the necessary power to maintain speed and maneuver with the target, preventing future `stall warnings` (which indicate your `angle of attack` is too high, risking a loss of lift) and helping you keep your `pitch deviation` and `heading deviation` closer to zero.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance on this enemy tracking exercise. This is likely your first time in a real aircraft, and you've done well to keep the aircraft under control. That's a critical first step.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft precisely centered in your view, tracking its movement while keeping safe airspeed and preventing stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control of the aircraft throughout the flight and did not crash, which is excellent, especially considering this is your first real flight. However, you consistently struggled to keep the enemy aircraft within visual parameters, experiencing significant pitch and heading deviations. Pitch deviation means your aircraft's nose was pointing too high or too low relative to the enemy, while heading deviation means you were pointed too far left or right. These large deviations meant you lost sight of the target often. You also encountered multiple stall warnings, indicating that your wings were nearing a loss of lift due to excessive Angle of Attack (AoA), which can be dangerous. This resulted in the enemy plane continuously gaining distance on you throughout the flight.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on making small, smooth, and coordinated control inputs with the centre stick and rudder pedals. If the target moves high or low, make gentle forward or backward adjustments to the centre stick to control your pitch (nose up or down). If the target moves left or right, gently twist the centre stick left or right to roll the aircraft, and simultaneously apply the corresponding rudder pedal (left stick twist with left rudder, right stick twist with right rudder) to execute a smooth, coordinated turn. Continuously monitor your airspeed on the G1000's Primary Flight Display (PFD) and your Angle of Attack (AoA) to maintain a safe and steady speed, preventing those stall warnings. Remember, small, precise corrections are always more effective than large, abrupt ones in a Cessna.

Alright, Airman, let's go over that flight.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to consistently maintain visual contact and close distance with the enemy aircraft for effective tracking.

**How am I doing?**
You did well maintaining overall aircraft control and didn't crash, which is excellent for your first real flight! However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy due to significant heading deviation, meaning you were consistently pointing too far left. Your distance to the target also steadily increased, and you experienced multiple stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to actively manage your throttle and execute coordinated turns. First, increase throttle (push forward on the lever) to accelerate and close the distance. For your persistent left heading deviation, you need to turn right: apply right rudder (push right foot pedal) and right stick (move the centre stick right) simultaneously. This is a "coordinated turn" – using both controls to turn smoothly, preventing excessive Angle of Attack (AoA), which caused those stall warnings. As the turn establishes, gradually reduce rudder pressure. Focus on keeping your airspeed (KIAS) healthy and the target centered.

Alright recruit, excellent work staying in the air and maintaining control of the aircraft; that's a crucial first step for any pilot. Let's review your performance on this tracking mission.

**What are my goals?**
Your goals are to maintain the enemy aircraft within your visual sight, effectively manage your airspeed, and strategically close the distance while avoiding stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You did well to avoid crashing and maintain flight, which is crucial. However, you frequently received *stall warnings* (an audible alert when your wings lose lift) and struggled to keep the enemy aircraft within your sight, causing you to fall further behind.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on proactive energy management by coordinating your throttle and centre stick inputs. Increase your throttle ratio (engine power) above 0.5 to gain speed and close on the target. If the stall warning sounds, immediately lower your nose slightly with the centre stick to reduce your *angle of attack* (how much your wing bites the air) and regain speed. Then, use smaller, precise stick adjustments for better target centering.

Alright, Trainee, great job keeping the aircraft stable throughout the flight, especially considering the challenging nature of this tracking exercise! You managed to keep the plane flying, which is a fundamental achievement.

**What are my goals?** Your primary goal is to maintain a stable tracking solution by controlling distance, minimizing deviations, and avoiding stalls while staying behind the enemy.

**How am I doing?** You're consistently falling behind the enemy aircraft, and your control inputs are leading to significant pitch and heading deviations, often resulting in repeated stall warnings.

**How to improve?** To close the distance and regain control, you need to increase your throttle. Advance the throttle forward to a higher setting, like 0.8 or full, to provide more thrust. This added power will increase your airspeed (KIAS) and give you more energy, allowing for smoother, more effective pitch and heading adjustments with your centre stick without reaching a high Angle of Attack (AoA), which triggers the stall warning. Remember, the stall warning indicates your wing is nearing a stall (losing lift); smoothly relax back pressure on the centre stick to reduce AoA when it sounds, then add power.

Alright, recruit, that was your first time flying a real plane, even if it was just in the simulator, and you did well staying in the air!

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain precise tracking of the enemy, minimizing distance and deviation, while safely managing your aircraft's energy state.

**How am I doing?**
You flew the aircraft without crashing, which is excellent for a first flight! However, you lost significant tracking, with large pitch and heading deviations, and experienced frequent stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on integrating your throttle and centre stick inputs to maintain precise tracking. This means when the enemy pulls away, increase your throttle (engine power) to maximum (1.0 ratio) to gain speed and close distance. Simultaneously, use small, smooth inputs on your centre stick for both pitch (nose up/down) and roll (wing tilt) to keep the target continuously centered in your view. If you hear a stall warning, which indicates your Angle of Attack (AoA – the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) is too high, immediately pitch the nose down slightly while adding full throttle to recover airspeed.

Alright trainee, great job on your first simulator flight! It takes courage to step into a cockpit, even a simulated one, and you handled the aircraft without crashing, which is excellent for a first-timer.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain precise target alignment by minimizing pitch and heading deviations, while actively managing your aircraft's energy.

**How am I doing?**
You did well maintaining continuous flight without a crash, but your main challenge was consistently large heading deviations, which meant the enemy aircraft was often out of your visual tracking limits.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on making continuous, small adjustments with your centre stick. For instance, if the target drifts left (negative heading deviation), apply gentle right stick pressure until it centers, then immediately neutralize the stick. Simultaneously, use the throttle to manage your distance; if you're falling behind and distance is increasing rapidly, smoothly increase throttle to close the gap.

Alright recruit, great job on your first simulator flight! It's a big step getting into the cockpit, and you handled the controls well overall. You didn't crash, which is always the primary objective, so well done!

Here's your debrief:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain target visual contact, reduce distance, and avoid stall warnings for a safe, effective tracking flight.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control and avoided crashing, excellent for a first flight! However, you consistently increased distance from the enemy and experienced frequent stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, actively manage your airspeed and distance by increasing throttle when falling behind. Simultaneously, use smaller, gentler pitch inputs on the centre stick to avoid high Angle of Attack (AoA), which causes stall warnings. This ensures you maintain safe flying speed (KIAS) and stay on target.

Alright pilot, great job on your first training flight! It's a big step getting into a real plane, and you handled it well by keeping us in the air.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain close proximity and precise visual tracking of the enemy aircraft while avoiding stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You did well avoiding a crash, which is a great start! However, you consistently fell behind the enemy and frequently entered stall warnings, indicating difficulty maintaining both closure and stable flight control.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to actively manage your airspeed with the throttle and make small, coordinated control inputs. When the enemy pulls away, increase your throttle ratio by pushing the throttle forward to gain speed. For tracking, use gentle, coordinated inputs on the centre stick for pitch (nose up/down) and roll (wing tilt), along with the rudder pedals (foot controls for yaw, or nose left/right) for smooth, coordinated turns to precisely align your aircraft with the target and prevent large deviations.

Alright recruit, great job getting through your first simulator flight! It takes courage to step into the cockpit, and you definitely showed that by maintaining stable flight throughout. No crashes on a first solo is a huge win, so give yourself a pat on the back for that!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain a consistent distance and precise tracking of the enemy aircraft, avoiding large deviations and stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained stable flight without crashing, which is commendable! However, you consistently fell behind the enemy due to insufficient speed, leading to increasing distance and tracking difficulties.

**How to improve?**
To improve, the most critical adjustment is throttle management. To close the distance on the enemy, you must increase your throttle ratio significantly, ideally towards 1.0, to gain Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) – your speed through the air. Additionally, practice making smaller, smoother centre stick inputs to reduce large pitch and heading deviations and avoid triggering the stall warning – an alert that your wing is losing lift.

Alright, let's get you squared away, pilot! You've taken the first step into the cockpit, and that takes courage. There's plenty to build on here.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft within your sight by precisely controlling your aircraft's pitch and heading.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good pitch control during several segments, keeping the enemy vertically centered, and commendable job avoiding any crashes during this challenging exercise.

**How to improve?**
To improve, prioritize precise heading control: when the enemy is to your left (indicated by a negative heading deviation), apply left roll input by pushing the centre stick to the *left* to align your aircraft. Simultaneously, increase your throttle to gain speed and close the distance to the target, ensuring you don't approach a stall by maintaining adequate airspeed.

Alright, Cadet, excellent work on your first simulator flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed initially, but you handled the aircraft well enough to avoid any crashes, which is a fantastic achievement for a first-timer.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to precisely maintain position behind the enemy aircraft, keeping them consistently centered in your view, without losing sight.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully avoided any crashes, which is crucial for your first flight! That's a great start. However, you are consistently falling behind the enemy, often losing sight due to increasing distance and large deviations.

**How to improve?**
To close the distance and maintain your position, you must actively manage your throttle. If you see the enemy pulling away (distance increasing), push the throttle control forward to increase engine power. Be prepared for the aircraft's nose to pitch up as power increases; counter this by pushing your center stick forward to lower the nose and maintain vertical alignment with the target. This coordinated input of increasing power and adjusting pitch is crucial for effective tracking.

Good effort, pilot! This simulator is a challenging but crucial step in your training.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain precise visual contact, minimizing pitch and heading deviations, and managing airspeed to stay within optimal tracking parameters.

**How am I doing?**
While you maintained a consistent throttle setting, you consistently lost sight of the enemy due to large heading deviations, indicating insufficient roll input.

**How to improve?**
To improve, actively use your centre stick for roll control and the throttle for speed management. If the target drifts left, apply smooth left stick pressure to roll into a turn. Simultaneously, adjust throttle: increase if distance grows, decrease if it shrinks. When turning, add gentle back pressure on the stick to maintain altitude; avoid excessive pitch inputs that could lead to a stall warning (where the wing loses lift).

Alright, Trainee, great job on your first simulator flight! It's completely normal to face challenges when you're starting out, and you did an excellent job maintaining control of the aircraft without crashing, even when things got tricky. That shows good foundational stick-and-rudder skills.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and an optimal tracking position directly behind the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
While you kept the aircraft safe, you consistently lost sight of the enemy, especially in heading, and the distance between your Cessna and the target increased significantly throughout the flight.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your aircraft's energy. When the enemy aircraft begins to turn, smoothly increase your throttle to full (1.0 ratio) and use coordinated centre stick inputs (pitch and roll) to match the enemy's turn rate, aiming to keep them centered in your view while maintaining a safe airspeed and optimal angle of attack.

Alright, Cadet! Let's review your performance. You've taken the controls of a real aircraft for the first time, and that's a huge step.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain sight of the enemy by keeping pitch deviation within +/- 8 degrees and heading deviation within +/- 30 degrees, while managing your aircraft's energy.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good control and stability before the enemy initiated its maneuver. However, once the enemy began turning, you consistently lost sight of the target due to large pitch and heading deviations, frequently activating the stall warning.

**How to improve?**
To improve, prioritize power management and coordinated turns. As the enemy begins to maneuver, immediately increase your throttle to 1.0 (full power). Then, use smooth, coordinated centre stick inputs to match the enemy's turn, avoiding excessive aft stick that causes stalls and helps you maintain sight.

Alright pilot, great job keeping the aircraft under control throughout this challenging flight! Avoiding a crash, especially on your first time in a real plane simulator, shows excellent fundamental stick and rudder skills.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal tracking position, minimizing deviation and managing energy effectively to stay with the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control and avoided a crash, which is excellent for your first flight! However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft, especially during its turn, and the distance between you and the target increased significantly throughout the flight.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your throttle. When the enemy aircraft begins its turn, immediately increase your throttle to full power (throttle ratio 1.0) to maintain energy and turn performance. Simultaneously, coordinate your centre stick roll and pitch inputs to match the enemy's turn, aiming to keep pitch and heading deviations near zero.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your flight. You've just completed a demanding tracking exercise, and I want to commend you on staying in the air; you didn't crash, which is always the first priority.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain sight of and track the enemy aircraft effectively while ensuring safe flight by avoiding stalls and excessive deviations.

**How am I doing?**
While you maintained a stable flight path before the enemy maneuver, you consistently lost sight of the enemy and experienced multiple stall warnings as they initiated their turn, indicating a significant delay in your control inputs.

**How to improve?**
When the enemy initiates a turn, you must immediately apply coordinated centre stick roll and pitch inputs. Roll the stick in the direction of their turn to match their bank angle, and simultaneously pull back on the stick (positive pitch) to increase your angle of attack and maintain altitude, ensuring your airspeed (KIAS) remains above the stall warning threshold.

Alright, Trainee! That was your first real flight tracking an enemy aircraft, and you did well under pressure. Let's break it down.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to keep the enemy aircraft precisely centered in your view, maintain appropriate distance, and avoid stalling the aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated excellent aircraft control by avoiding a crash, a great start for your first flight! However, you struggled to maintain visual contact with the enemy, evident in significant pitch and heading deviations, especially when the enemy aircraft turned.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must integrate active throttle management. When the enemy initiates a turn, like at 4.59s, smoothly increase your throttle (e.g., to a 0.8-1.0 ratio) to maintain airspeed and energy. This will provide the power needed to execute effective pitch and roll inputs, allowing you to stay on target without reducing speed and entering a stall.

Alright pilot, let's go over that flight. You did a good job staying focused in the simulator, which is key for these missions!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy aircraft by precisely controlling your aircraft's pitch and heading.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good initial stability before the enemy maneuver, but struggled to maintain effective tracking once they turned. Your control inputs were often delayed and then overly aggressive, leading to significant deviations, frequent "lost sight" moments, and multiple **stall warnings** (when the wing loses lift, often due to too high an Angle of Attack).

**How to improve?**
Focus on making small, smooth, and coordinated control inputs. As the enemy maneuvers, apply gentle **centre stick roll** (tilting the stick left/right to bank the wings) to match their turn and **centre stick pitch** (pushing/pulling the stick to move the nose up/down) to keep the target vertically centered. Simultaneously, use the **throttle** (power control) to manage your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed), increasing power to close distance or reducing it to avoid overshooting. Avoid abrupt inputs to prevent oscillations and stalls.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance on this tracking exercise.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain effective visual contact and control, keeping the enemy aircraft within tracking parameters throughout the maneuver.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control of the aircraft and did not crash, which is a great start for your first real flight! However, your tracking of the enemy aircraft became ineffective, as evidenced by large distance, pitch, and heading deviations.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must proactively anticipate and respond to the enemy's maneuvers using coordinated control inputs. When the enemy begins its turn, immediately apply smooth centre stick roll input to *bank* your aircraft in the same direction. Simultaneously, apply gentle back pressure on the centre stick (pitch input) to initiate your turn, using the G1000's *attitude indicator* to maintain a consistent bank angle. Critically, you kept your throttle at a 0.5 ratio throughout the flight. To maintain energy and close distance, you must increase throttle *before* or *as* you begin a turn, especially when attempting to maneuver with the enemy. This proactive power management prevents high *angle of attack* and avoids *stall warnings*, ensuring you stay with the target.

Alright recruit, listen up. This is likely your first time in a real plane, so great job keeping it in the air. That’s a crucial first step!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain accurate tracking by minimizing pitch and heading deviations, keeping the enemy aircraft continuously in sight.

**How am I doing?**
You did well by not crashing, which is crucial for a first flight! However, you reacted very late to the enemy aircraft's right turn at 4.59 seconds. This led to large heading deviations (your nose pointing too far left/right of the target) and several **stall warnings** (an alert indicating your wing is about to stop producing enough lift to fly) due to aggressive, uncoordinated pitch inputs.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on anticipating enemy maneuvers and applying *smooth, coordinated* control inputs. When the enemy turns, use gentle centre stick roll (left/right) to match their bank, and simultaneously apply slight centre stick pitch (forward/back) to maintain your vertical position. Avoid abrupt, full stick deflections, which cause significant deviations and can lead to stalls.

Alright recruit, listen up. This is your first time in a real bird, even if it's a simulator, and you're doing well just getting off the ground and staying in one piece. That's a crucial first step!

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain precise position behind the enemy by coordinating timely pitch, roll, and throttle inputs to minimize deviation.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully avoided a crash, demonstrating basic aircraft control. However, your initial lack of inputs allowed the enemy to gain a significant lead, and subsequent large control inputs led to repeated stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on making *small, precise* control inputs immediately when the enemy begins a maneuver. When the enemy turns right, gently apply a *slight right roll* with the centre stick to *bank* (tilt the wings), followed by a *small pull* on the stick to initiate a turn. Simultaneously, increase throttle to maintain airspeed (KIAS) and close distance, then reduce it as you get closer. Avoid large, abrupt stick movements that lead to stall warnings.

Alright, let's go over your tracking flight. You did well to keep the aircraft under control and avoid a crash, especially given the challenging conditions. That's a crucial first step in any flight!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft within your visual tracking limits by precisely controlling your aircraft's pitch (nose up/down) and heading (direction).

**How am I doing?**
You successfully avoided a crash, which is a great start! However, your control inputs were significantly delayed when the enemy aircraft began its maneuver, leading to large pitch and heading deviations and a loss of visual contact.

**How to improve?**
Focus on immediate and coordinated control inputs. When the enemy initiates a turn, apply smooth, proportional centre stick input: roll into the turn (tilting the wings) and simultaneously apply appropriate back pressure to pitch up (raising the nose) to maintain sight. Avoid large, abrupt inputs that can lead to stalls (loss of lift). Remember, small, timely corrections are key to effective tracking.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Maintain optimal tracking distance, precisely center the target, and manage your airspeed to avoid stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You successfully avoided a crash, demonstrating basic aircraft control. However, your distance to the enemy aircraft steadily increased, and you consistently lost visual contact due to significant pitch and heading deviations, often experiencing stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your throttle inputs to control your airspeed, especially during turns. When maneuvering with the centre stick, make smooth, smaller corrections. Adjust your throttle to maintain energy and avoid exceeding the aircraft's Angle of Attack (AoA) limits – the angle of the wing relative to the oncoming air – to prevent stalls.

Alright, Trainee! That was your first time in the simulator, and you handled it well without a single crash, which is a fantastic start and shows great potential. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain consistent visual contact with the enemy aircraft by accurately centering it both vertically and horizontally.

**How am I doing?**
You've maintained flight without crashing, which is crucial. However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy due to large heading deviations, and encountered multiple stall warnings, indicating aggressive pitch inputs and significant speed loss (Knots Indicated Airspeed or KIAS).

**How to improve?**
To improve, make smaller, smoother, and more coordinated control inputs with your centre stick, especially for heading. Focus on maintaining a consistent Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) by making gentle pitch adjustments, rather than large, abrupt changes, to avoid stall warnings.

Alright, Cadet, let's review your first tracking flight in the Cessna. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed on your first real-world flight, and you did a great job keeping the aircraft stable and not crashing, which is always paramount.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft within your targeting reticle by minimizing both pitch and heading deviations.

**How am I doing?**
You consistently kept the enemy aircraft behind your plane, which is a good start. However, your large heading deviations frequently caused you to lose sight of the target.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on making smaller, more precise centre stick inputs for heading control. When the enemy is too far left (indicated by a negative heading deviation), apply gentle right stick pressure to smoothly bring the nose right and re-center the target. Avoid large, abrupt turns.

Alright pilot, let's go over your performance. This was likely your first time flying a real plane, even if it's a simulator, and you did well to keep it in the air without crashing! That's a crucial first step.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy aircraft by precisely controlling your aircraft's pitch, heading, and distance.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained a consistent throttle setting throughout the flight, which is a good baseline for stability. However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy due to large pitch and heading deviations, often resulting in stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
Focus on smoother, smaller control inputs. If the enemy target appears *above* your current view (meaning you are pointing too low), gently pull the centre stick *back* to pitch up. If it appears *below* your current view (meaning you are pointing too high), gently push the stick *forward* to pitch down. Avoid large, abrupt stick movements, especially pulling back too hard, which caused your stall warnings and significant airspeed loss. To correct horizontal position, use coordinated stick and rudder: if the enemy is to your *left* (negative heading deviation), push the stick *right* and apply *right* rudder to turn right. Simultaneously, manage your distance by adjusting throttle: push the throttle lever *forward* to increase speed and close on the enemy, or pull it *back* to slow down and maintain separation. Anticipate enemy movements to make proactive, not reactive, corrections.

Alright, Airman, excellent job staying calm and avoiding a crash during this challenging tracking exercise. You maintained a consistent throttle input, which is a great start for control stability.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain continuous visual contact, accurately tracking the enemy aircraft by minimizing both pitch and heading deviations.

**How am I doing?**
You are consistently falling behind the enemy and frequently losing visual contact, primarily due to large horizontal (heading) deviations.

**How to improve?**
To regain control and track effectively, immediately apply full throttle (engine power, ratio 1.0) to increase your speed (KIAS). Simultaneously, when the enemy drifts left (negative heading deviation, meaning they are to your left), smoothly apply right rudder and right stick to turn the aircraft right in a coordinated turn (using stick and rudder together for smooth, efficient turns) and recenter them. This will help you close the distance and avoid future stall warnings by maintaining sufficient airspeed and control.

Alright, Trainee, great job getting in the simulator today! It's your first time flying a real plane, even if it's a simulation, and you kept the aircraft under control throughout the entire flight and didn't crash, which is commendable. That shows good foundational stability, so well done!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a stable distance and keep the enemy aircraft precisely centered in your view, using coordinated pitch and heading adjustments.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained aircraft control throughout the flight, which is excellent for your first time. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft, both vertically and horizontally, and the distance between you increased significantly. You also encountered several stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking and maintain proximity, you must actively use the throttle. When the enemy aircraft pulls away, increase throttle (push the lever forward, located to your left) to gain speed and close the distance. Simultaneously, make smaller, smoother inputs with your centre stick to keep the target centered: use gentle pitch adjustments (pull/push stick) for vertical alignment, and for horizontal tracking, apply gentle roll and twist the stick for rudder, ensuring coordinated turns to smoothly follow the enemy.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance on this tracking exercise. Remember, this is how we learn and get better!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, controlling both distance and relative position precisely.

**How am I doing?**
Great job keeping the aircraft airborne and avoiding any crashes! However, you're consistently falling behind the enemy, with your distance increasing throughout the flight. This led to significant pitch and heading deviations—meaning you were pointing too high/low or left/right of the target—often losing sight and triggering multiple stall warnings, which indicate your wing was about to lose lift.

**How to improve?**
Your key area to improve is active power management. You kept your throttle at 0.5, which isn't enough to catch up. When behind, smoothly advance throttle to increase your KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed, your displayed speed). Continuously adjust power to maintain your desired tracking distance and use precise center stick inputs to prevent excessive pitch changes and avoid future stall warnings.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance in the simulator. You're doing well and showing great potential.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain precise distance and alignment with the enemy aircraft, avoiding stalls by effectively managing your aircraft's energy.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated excellent recovery instincts by avoiding a crash despite multiple 'stall warnings' (where the wing loses lift), which is commendable. However, you consistently fell behind the enemy and struggled to maintain stable vertical and horizontal tracking.

**How to improve?**
Your main area for improvement is active energy management. Your constant 'throttle' (power setting) limited your ability to adjust speed. To improve tracking and prevent future stalls – due to too high an 'Angle of Attack' (AoA) at low 'KIAS' (Knots Indicated Airspeed) – you must coordinate your throttle with your 'centre stick' (pitch) inputs. Increase throttle to gain KIAS and close distance, or prevent stalls when pitching up. This coordination will allow you to precisely correct your 'pitch deviation' (vertical alignment) and 'heading deviation' (horizontal alignment) to re-center the target.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance. Remember, this is about learning, and you're doing great for your first time in the air!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy aircraft by precisely matching its flight path.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good stability before the enemy initiated its turn, but you lost sight of the enemy aircraft early in its maneuver due to a significant delay in applying flight control inputs.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must react *immediately* to target movement. When the enemy begins to turn, smoothly apply coordinated centre stick roll input in the *same direction* as the enemy's turn to match their bank, and simultaneously use appropriate pitch input to keep them vertically centered. Also, remember to manage your throttle to maintain a suitable airspeed for maneuvering and staying with the target.

Alright recruit, let's go over your performance. It's your first time in a real plane, and you did a solid job maintaining basic flight control and didn't crash, which is a great start!

**What are my goals?**
To accurately track the enemy aircraft by maintaining correct relative position, controlling pitch, heading, and airspeed.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control and avoided a crash, which is commendable. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft, particularly during its right turn, indicating difficulty with accurate tracking.

**How to improve?**
When the enemy aircraft initiated its right turn, your aircraft was banking left. To follow a right turn, you must apply *right* roll input by pushing the centre stick to the *right*. Coordinate this with appropriate pitch input (pulling the stick *back*) to maintain the target vertically centered, while managing throttle to control airspeed and avoid stalls.

Alright recruit, great job getting into the simulator and taking on this challenge! This is likely your first time flying a real plane, even simulated, so let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to consistently maintain the enemy aircraft within your visual sight picture by precisely matching its flight path, while safely managing your aircraft's energy.

**How am I doing?**
You started well but struggled to maintain visual contact during the enemy's right turn, leading to significant heading and pitch deviations and several dangerous stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on proactive control inputs. When the enemy turns, apply more assertive **roll** input with your **centre stick** (push the stick right) to match their turn. **Roll** is the aircraft's rotation around its nose-to-tail axis. Simultaneously, adjust your **throttle** (push the throttle lever forward) to maintain **airspeed** and prevent falling behind, especially when turning. If you hear the **stall warning** (an alert indicating the wing is losing lift due to high **angle of attack**), immediately reduce back pressure on the stick to decrease your **angle of attack** and regain airspeed.

Alright, Trainee, great job getting into the simulator for your first flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, but you're doing well.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy aircraft by precisely matching its maneuvers and staying within tracking parameters.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained a stable flight path initially and avoided any dangerous stalls or crashes, which is commendable for your first time. However, you struggled significantly with reacting to the enemy's right turn, resulting in large pitch and heading deviations, causing you to lose sight of the target.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must react more quickly to the enemy's maneuvers. When the enemy aircraft begins to turn, immediately apply a corresponding roll input with your centre stick in the *same direction*. For a right turn, push the stick to the *right* to bank your aircraft. Banking is tilting your wings to initiate a turn. Coordinate this roll with gentle back pressure on the stick (pitch up) to keep the enemy centered vertically in your view as you turn. This will help maintain visual contact and stay on target.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance on this tracking exercise. Remember, this is likely your first time handling an aircraft, and you did well staying focused and not crashing, which is always the priority!

Before we dive into the feedback, let's clarify a couple of terms:

*   **Coordinated Control Inputs:** This refers to using your centre stick (for pitch and roll) and rudder pedals (to control yaw, which aligns the nose) smoothly together to execute a turn without slipping or skidding.
*   **Sideslip:** This occurs when your aircraft is moving sideways relative to the airflow, often due to uncoordinated turns. A large sideslip angle indicates poor coordination.

Now, let's review your flight performance:

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy aircraft by precisely matching its flight path, minimizing both pitch and heading deviations.

**How am I doing?**
You did well in maintaining a consistent throttle setting for much of the flight, but you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft due to significant and delayed deviations in both pitch and heading, leading to a stall warning.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must anticipate and apply timely, coordinated control inputs. When the enemy began its right turn at 4.59s, you needed to immediately apply right roll with your centre stick while adjusting pitch to maintain vertical alignment, and crucially, increase throttle to manage airspeed and sustain the turn, preventing the significant sideslip and stall warning observed.

Alright, Trainee! That was your first time in the simulator, and you did well in maintaining a general direction and keeping the aircraft flying safely. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft precisely centered in your sights throughout its maneuvers, minimizing both pitch and heading deviations.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good initial tracking before the enemy maneuvered, but significantly struggled with lateral control, failing to match the enemy's right turn and losing sight.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must proactively apply **right roll input** with the centre stick as soon as the enemy begins its right turn. Continuously adjust this right roll by pushing the stick to the right or left to precisely match its turn rate, keeping its heading centered in your view on the G1000 display.

Alright, pilot! Great job getting us airborne and starting off smoothly. You maintained a good initial flight path, which is a solid foundation.

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain precise visual tracking of the enemy, minimizing pitch and heading deviations to stay within sight.

**How am I doing?**
You started well with stable flight, but frequently lost sight of the enemy due to significant pitch and heading deviations, especially once they initiated their right turn.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must apply timely and coordinated centre stick inputs: when the enemy turns right, immediately apply *right* stick (positive roll ratio) to match their bank, and pull *back* on the stick (positive pitch ratio) to counter any vertical separation, ensuring you stay in sight.

Alright, Trainee! First flight in the simulator, that's a big step, and you did well in maintaining control of the aircraft throughout the flight.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to actively use flight controls to maintain visual contact and minimize pitch and heading deviations, while closing the distance to the enemy.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained stable power throughout the flight, avoiding any stalls, which is a good foundational start. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft after they initiated their turn around the 4.5-second mark, failing to apply timely control inputs to follow the maneuver, leading to a significant increase in distance.

**How to improve?**
To improve, when the enemy initiates a turn, you must immediately apply coordinated control inputs: for a right turn, roll *right* by smoothly pushing the centre stick to the right. Concurrently, use pitch control (pulling or pushing the stick forward/back) to keep the target centered vertically within your view.

Alright recruit, great job getting in the simulator! It's your first time flying a real plane, albeit simulated, and you handled it without crashing, which is an excellent start. That shows good basic control.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain visual contact and control your distance to effectively track the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You handled the aircraft well without any crashes, which is excellent for your first flight. However, you struggled to maintain sight of the enemy, leading to large pitch and heading deviations and a significant increase in tracking distance.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively manage your **throttle**. You kept the throttle constant at 50%, which caused the distance to the enemy to continuously grow. Push the throttle forward to increase your speed and close the distance, or pull it back to decrease speed if you're closing too fast. This dynamic throttle control, combined with coordinated **centre stick** inputs for **pitch** (nose up/down) and **roll** (wing tilt), is crucial for maintaining a stable tracking range and keeping the enemy centered in your view.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance. Remember, this simulator is designed to prepare you for the real deal, and every flight is a learning opportunity. You did well to maintain control of the aircraft throughout the flight and avoid a crash, which is paramount.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft and to precisely match its flight path, ensuring you stay within optimal tracking parameters.

**How am I doing?**
You frequently lost sight of the enemy aircraft, especially during its right turn, due to significant deviations in both your pitch and heading, indicating you struggled to match its maneuver.

**How to improve?**
To improve, anticipate the enemy's turn earlier; as it begins to bank right, apply smooth, coordinated *right centre stick roll input* (pushing the stick right) to match its bank angle, and simultaneously use *aft centre stick pitch input* (pulling the stick back) to maintain vertical alignment. Crucially, adjust your *throttle inputs* (pushing it forward to gain speed) to manage airspeed and close the rapidly increasing distance, rather than keeping it constant, which will help you maintain a tighter track and avoid stall warnings.

Alright, Cadet, great job staying with it and avoiding any incidents in what was likely your first time in a real plane simulator! That's a crucial first step.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy, precisely matching its flight path and keeping your distance stable.

**How am I doing?**
While you maintained control, you quickly lost sight of the enemy during its turn, indicated by significant pitch and heading deviations. This resulted in your distance rapidly increasing.

**How to improve?**
When the enemy begins its turn, immediately match its **bank angle** (aircraft tilt) by rolling your **centre stick** in the same direction. Simultaneously, use small, precise **pitch** inputs (forward/back on the stick) to keep the target centered vertically. Finally, adjust your **throttle** (power setting) to control your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed, your speed), preventing the distance from growing so quickly. Focus on smooth, coordinated control inputs.

Alright, pilot, let's break down that flight. You did a great job holding your position initially. That takes focus and precision.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft by precisely matching its flight path, ensuring minimal pitch and heading deviation.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained good initial stability before the enemy maneuver. However, you lost sight of the enemy during its turn, indicating a delayed and overly aggressive reaction to the change in its flight path.

**How to improve?**
When tracking, anticipate enemy maneuvers and apply smooth, proportional centre stick inputs. For instance, as the enemy turns right, gently and progressively apply right roll (centre stick to the right) and back pressure (centre stick back) to initiate your own turn, simultaneously increasing throttle (push throttle forward) to maintain airspeed and energy, especially during a turn.

Alright, Trainee, great job getting into the simulator today! This is your first step towards becoming a skilled pilot, and you're already showing potential.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and minimize your aircraft's pitch and heading deviations from the enemy.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained initial aircraft stability well. However, your primary challenge was the almost complete lack of centre stick control inputs during the enemy's manoeuvre, causing you to fall significantly behind and lose sight of the target.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must actively use the centre stick from the very start. Continuously adjust your aircraft's pitch by pulling back on the stick to raise the nose (pitch up) or pushing forward to lower the nose (pitch down). Simultaneously, use the stick to roll your aircraft: push right to roll right and turn right, and push left to roll left and turn left. Your objective is to keep the enemy aircraft centered in your windscreen at all times, anticipating its movements with smooth, constant control inputs.

Alright, Airman, that was a solid first flight in the simulator! You kept the aircraft in the air and consistently stayed behind the enemy, which is a great starting point for tracking. We'll build on that.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy, effectively managing your flight path to prevent losing sight or stalling.

**How am I doing?**
While you managed to stay behind the enemy throughout, you frequently lost visual contact as the distance grew excessively, indicated by the 'lost sight of enemy' grading. This was often accompanied by stall warnings (when your wing's angle of attack is too high), suggesting uncoordinated and abrupt control inputs, especially a lack of throttle management.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on integrating throttle management with smoother, coordinated stick inputs. Actively use your throttle (engine power), pushing it forward when the enemy turns to maintain your Kias (Knots Indicated Airspeed) and energy. Simultaneously, make smaller, gentle adjustments on the centre stick for pitch (nose up/down) and roll (wing tilt), always using your rudder pedals to keep the sideslip angle (sideways movement) near zero. This precise control will maintain target alignment and prevent stall warnings.

Alright, Trainee, let's go over your performance on this tracking exercise. You've taken the first step in flying, and that's a big accomplishment!

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain sight and a consistent tracking position behind the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control of the aircraft and avoided a crash, which is commendable for your first time flying a real plane. However, you struggled significantly with tracking the enemy, especially during its right turn, resulting in a complete loss of sight and a large increase in distance.

**How to improve?**
When the enemy initiates a turn, you must proactively apply smooth right roll input with the centre stick to match their bank angle. This means pushing the stick to the *right*. Simultaneously, apply appropriate **back pressure** (pulling the stick back) to maintain your pitch and prevent falling below the target. Avoid excessive stick inputs, especially large pitch changes that triggered **stall warnings** (an alert indicating insufficient lift), which can lead to losing control. Focus on small, precise corrections to keep the enemy centered.
