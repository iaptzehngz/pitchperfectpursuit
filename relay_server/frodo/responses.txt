Alright, cadet, let's go over your flight data. This is your first time in a real aircraft, and that comes with a lot of new sensations and skills to learn. You did a good job of keeping the aircraft pointed generally towards the enemy initially, which shows good recognition of the target. Now, let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain precise control of your aircraft to consistently track the enemy, ensuring you never lose sight.

**How am I doing?**
You started well by maintaining a consistent distance behind the enemy, which is a good initial position for tracking. However, as the enemy aircraft initiated its manoeuvre, your control inputs were either absent or too abrupt, leading to significant deviations in both pitch and heading. This resulted in your aircraft experiencing extreme nose-down attitudes and uncontrolled rolls, triggering frequent stall warnings and ultimately causing you to lose visual contact with the enemy.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to focus on making small, deliberate, and continuous control inputs with the yoke to manage your pitch and roll. Simultaneously, you must actively use the throttle to maintain appropriate airspeed and prevent stalls; if the stall warning activates (an audible alert that your wings are losing lift due to insufficient airspeed or excessive angle of attack, the angle at which your wing meets the oncoming air), immediately apply full power and smoothly reduce your pitch to regain critical airspeed and lift. Developing this coordinated control will allow you to anticipate and react to enemy manoeuvres effectively and maintain continuous tracking.

Alright, recruit, that was your first taste of tracking, and I know it can be a lot to take in! You did a good job of maintaining control before the enemy aircraft started its maneuver, showing you're already getting a feel for the Cessna. That's a solid start!

Before we dive into your performance, let's quickly clarify a few terms you'll hear me use:
*   A **bank angle** refers to how much you tilt the wings of the aircraft using the **yoke** (the control stick).
*   **Coordinated rudder** means correctly using the rudder pedals to keep the aircraft's nose pointed straight into the wind during a turn, preventing a sideways slip or skid. You can usually tell this by keeping the 'ball' centered on the turn coordinator instrument on your G1000.
*   A **stall warning** is that audible alert indicating your wing is losing lift, which happens when your airspeed is too low or you pull the nose up too sharply.
*   Your **airspeed** is simply your speed through the air, measured in Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) on your G1000 Primary Flight Display.

Now, let's get into the specifics of what we observed. Remember, this is all about making you a top-tier pilot.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to precisely match the enemy aircraft's flight path, maintaining constant distance and keeping them directly in your field of view.

**How am I doing?**
You initially held your position well, but consistently fell behind the enemy during their turn, resulting in large heading and pitch deviations, which unfortunately led to frequently losing sight.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to aggressively increase your bank angle with the yoke to match the enemy's turn rate, using coordinated rudder and adjusting throttle to control airspeed, preventing stalls.

Alright, Cadet, excellent job getting in the cockpit for your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed with all the new information, but you've taken the crucial first step. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain consistent visual contact and an optimal tracking position on the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers, minimizing deviations.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good fundamental aircraft control in the initial phase of the flight, maintaining a stable pitch and heading before the enemy began its maneuver. This is a solid foundation, showing you have a good grasp of basic flight controls. However, once the enemy initiated its right turn at around 4 seconds, you struggled to maintain your tracking position. Your 'heading deviation' (how far off your aircraft's nose was from where it *should* have been pointing to follow the enemy) increased significantly, leading to you 'lost sight of enemy' for most of the maneuver. You also frequently activated the 'stall warning' (indicating your wing was losing lift and risking a loss of control), particularly when attempting to turn tightly with the enemy, which suggests you were pulling back too hard on the yoke.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, your immediate focus must be on proactive power management and coordinated control inputs. When the enemy initiates a maneuver, like their right turn, your first response should be to immediately advance the 'throttle ratio' (power setting) to full. This is crucial for gaining and maintaining airspeed ('KIAS' - Knots Indicated Airspeed) and energy, which are essential for your Cessna to turn effectively and prevent stall warnings. Simultaneously, execute smooth, coordinated turns: apply sufficient right 'yoke roll ratio' (turning the yoke left or right to bank the aircraft) to match the enemy's bank angle, and then *simultaneously* apply the appropriate 'yoke pitch ratio' (pulling back or pushing forward on the yoke to control your aircraft's nose up or down) to maintain altitude and tighten your turn, but be careful not to pull so hard that you hear the 'stall warning' activate again. To minimize your 'heading deviation' and avoid losing sight of the enemy, try to "lead" their turn by aiming slightly ahead of their current position in the direction they are turning, rather than reacting to their present position.

Alright, pilot, let's break down that flight. You've just completed your first enemy tracking training flight, and that's a huge step. You've shown good initial control and awareness, which is exactly what we look for in new trainees. Now, let's focus on refining your technique.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goals are to consistently maintain visual contact and an optimal tracking position behind the enemy aircraft throughout their maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You initially maintained good position, but struggled to turn with the enemy, leading to large heading deviations, increasing distance, and frequent stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, when the enemy aircraft initiates a turn, immediately apply coordinated controls: roll aggressively by turning the yoke in the direction of the turn, use the rudder pedals (the foot controls) to keep the turn coordinator's ball centered, and increase throttle to maintain airspeed and prevent stalls.

Alright, listen up, future fighter pilots! This is your first taste of actual tactical flying in a real aircraft, so let's break down your performance. You've taken the first step into a very exciting world, and I'm proud of you for getting airborne.

### What are my goals? (keep the response to this question to 25 words)

Your primary goal is to maintain close visual contact with the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers, ensuring safe and coordinated flight within the Cessna's limits.

### How am I doing?

First off, great job staying behind the enemy aircraft throughout the entire flight. That's a solid foundation for tracking. You consistently kept yourself in a trailing position, which is where you want to be for observation.

However, once the enemy initiated its right turn around the 4.38-second mark, we saw significant challenges. Your response to the enemy's maneuver was quite delayed; your control inputs only became noticeable much later, around the 13-second mark. When you did finally react, your inputs were often too abrupt and uncoordinated. For example, your Angle of Attack (AoA) spiked dangerously high (reaching 18.88 degrees at 13.65 seconds), leading to multiple stall warnings. An Angle of Attack is simply the angle between your wing and the oncoming air, and pulling too hard on the yoke can increase it to a point where the wing stops producing lift, causing a stall. This indicates you were pulling too hard on the yoke without enough speed or coordination.

Critically, your throttle remained at 0.5 (50%) throughout the entire flight. This prevented you from maintaining sufficient speed and energy, especially during the turn. As a direct result, the distance to the enemy aircraft rapidly increased from around 380 meters to over 9000 meters, and you consistently lost sight of the enemy due to massive pitch and heading deviations.

### How to improve?

To improve, we need to focus on three key areas of basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) fundamentals:

1.  **Timely and Coordinated Control Inputs:**
    *   **How to execute:** As soon as the enemy initiates a turn, you must react promptly. For a right turn, apply smooth, sufficient right roll input using the yoke. In the Cessna, for a sustained turn, aim for about 30-45 degrees of bank. As you apply roll, simultaneously use the rudder pedals to keep the slip/skid indicator (the "ball") centered on your G1000's Primary Flight Display (PFD). This ensures a coordinated turn, where your aircraft moves cleanly through the air without slipping or skidding sideways. Avoid abrupt, full deflections of the yoke; smooth inputs are key to precise tracking.

2.  **Active Throttle and Energy Management:**
    *   **How to execute:** Power is your best friend in turns, especially when you're trying to maintain speed or tighten your turn radius to stay close to a maneuvering target. Your throttle remained at 0.5 (50%) which was insufficient. As you initiate your turn, smoothly advance the throttle past 0.5, perhaps to 0.7 or 0.8 (70-80% power), depending on the desired turn rate and how much energy you need to maintain. Always observe your indicated airspeed (KIAS) on the G1000's PFD; maintain a safe airspeed (e.g., above 70 KIAS for a Cessna 172 in a turn) to prevent stalls and ensure you have enough energy to maneuver.

3.  **Maintain Awareness of Angle of Attack and Avoid Stalls:**
    *   **How to execute:** Pulling too hard on the yoke without enough airspeed or power will cause your Angle of Attack to increase rapidly, leading to a stall. The stall warning is there to tell you when you are approaching this critical condition. If you hear the stall warning or notice the AoA increasing rapidly (which you can monitor if your G1000 has an AoA indicator, but more importantly, feel it in the controls becoming "mushy" or soft), immediately reduce your pitch (gently push the yoke forward to nose down) and increase power to recover. This is crucial for safety. For effective tracking, you want to manage your turn rate and energy, not just pull back on the stick. Think about using less aggressive pitch changes and more consistent power to maintain your desired turn.

We'll work on these fundamentals in our next session. You've got the basic understanding of staying behind, now let's refine your control and energy management to stick to that enemy aircraft like glue! You're doing great for your first time, and these are common learning points. We'll get there!

Alright, recruit, that was your first taste of tracking in a real aircraft – a huge step! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed initially. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact and an effective tracking position on the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You did well keeping the aircraft stable during the initial phase of the flight, and importantly, you kept the aircraft flying safely without crashing, which is commendable for a first time. However, once the enemy aircraft began its right turn around the 4.38-second mark, your tracking significantly degraded. This was primarily due to a lack of timely control inputs and consistent throttle management, leading to frequent 'lost sight of enemy' heading deviations and several instances where your **stall warning** activated.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must initiate control inputs much earlier and more assertively. When the enemy aircraft begins its turn, you need to immediately apply appropriate right **yoke roll ratio** (banking the wings) to match their turn, and simultaneously manage your **pitch** (nose up/down) with the **yoke pitch ratio** to maintain your desired **Angle of Attack** (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) for the turn. Crucially, you must actively use the **throttle ratio** to manage your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed) and energy, matching the enemy's speed and preventing undesirable **stall warnings**. Remember to use rudder pedals for coordinated turns to minimize **sideslip angle** (flying sideways through the air) and keep your tracking smooth.

Alright, Trainee! Welcome to the cockpit. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed on your first real flight, but you're here to learn, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Let's look at your flight data from today's enemy tracking exercise.

### What are my goals?
To proficiently track enemy aircraft, maintaining visual contact and optimal position without losing control.

### How am I doing?
You demonstrated initial stability and a good starting position behind the enemy aircraft before it began its maneuver. However, once the enemy initiated its turn, you struggled significantly with control, leading to a rapid increase in deviation, multiple stall warnings, and ultimately losing sight of the target.

### How to improve?

Focus on coordinated, timely, and smooth control inputs, especially when matching enemy maneuvers, and actively manage your energy by adjusting throttle to maintain safe airspeed and prevent stalls.

Here's how to execute that:

1.  **Coordinate Your Turns and Anticipate Enemy Maneuvers:**
    *   **The Problem:** When the enemy aircraft began turning right (around the 4.38-second mark), your aircraft began to roll left, and your heading deviation rapidly increased, indicating you were not following the target. Your control inputs (`yoke roll ratio`) were either absent or very abrupt when they finally appeared.
    *   **The Fix:** Tracking an enemy requires anticipating their movements and applying smooth, coordinated control inputs to match their turn. If the enemy turns right, you must smoothly apply right aileron (turning the yoke to the right) to roll your wings into a right bank. Simultaneously, use your right rudder pedal to keep the slip-skid indicator (often called "the ball") centered on your G1000 Primary Flight Display (PFD). This keeps your turn "coordinated," meaning you're not slipping (sliding sideways towards the inside of the turn) or skidding (sliding sideways towards the outside of the turn). The aspect angle, which is the angle from your aircraft's tail to the enemy aircraft's nose, should ideally remain small (close to 0 degrees) when tracking directly behind them. Practice smooth, continuous control pressure rather than abrupt, large deflections.

2.  **Actively Manage Airspeed and Prevent Stalls:**
    *   **The Problem:** Your throttle setting remained at 0.5 (half power) throughout the entire flight, even when your airspeed (`kias`) dropped significantly during turns, causing your Angle of Attack (AoA) to climb to dangerous levels and triggering repeated `stall warning` indications. A stall occurs when the wings can no longer generate enough lift, often due to too high an AoA or insufficient airspeed. The stall warning horn indicates this is about to happen.
    *   **The Fix:** Turns, especially those with significant bank angles, increase drag and reduce your airspeed. To maintain energy and prevent a stall, you must actively manage your engine power. When initiating a turn, smoothly advance the throttle (increase `throttle ratio`) to add power. Keep an eye on your `kias` on the G1000 PFD; aim to stay within the green arc, which indicates your normal operating speed range. If you hear a stall warning, immediately reduce your AoA by smoothly pushing the yoke forward (reducing `yoke pitch ratio`) to regain airspeed, while simultaneously adding full power (`throttle ratio` to 1.0) and rolling wings level if necessary to recover. Never let your airspeed drop too low in a turn.

Keep practicing, Trainee. You've got the foundational stability; now we need to refine your active control and energy management during dynamic maneuvers. You'll get there!

Alright, trainee, let's break down that tracking flight. You've just experienced your first real taste of aircraft control under a dynamic scenario, and that's a huge step. You showed good initial awareness of the enemy's maneuver, which is a great starting point for developing your tracking skills.

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and optimal tracking distance behind the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You initiated pursuit, which is commendable, but you struggled with delayed and uncoordinated control inputs, leading to significant heading and pitch deviations where you lost sight of the enemy, and you repeatedly encountered stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must immediately initiate a coordinated turn with appropriate yoke (control stick) and rudder pedal inputs as the enemy aircraft maneuvers. For example, when the enemy turned right, you needed to apply right aileron (yoke to the right) and right rudder simultaneously. Simultaneously, smoothly add throttle to maintain your airspeed and energy, which will help you tighten your turn and prevent dangerous stall warnings, keeping the enemy in sight. Remember, "coordinated" means using both aileron and rudder in harmony to prevent "sideslip," which is when the aircraft moves sideways through the air, like a car skidding. Keeping your aircraft coordinated is crucial for efficient and safe turns.

Alright, cadet, great effort out there! This was your first time in a real aircraft, and you handled some challenging situations without crashing, which is a huge win. That shows excellent basic aircraft recovery instincts under pressure.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a stable, close tracking position behind the enemy aircraft, anticipating their maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated persistence in generally staying behind the enemy aircraft, and importantly, you safely avoided a crash despite experiencing multiple stall warnings and extreme attitude changes. However, your control inputs were too aggressive and uncoordinated, leading to erratic flight, frequent loss of visual contact, and significant deviations from the enemy's flight path.

**How to improve?**
Focus on developing smooth, coordinated control inputs. When initiating or recovering from turns, apply aileron (moving the yoke left or right) and simultaneously use the rudder pedals to "step on the ball" on the G1000's slip-skid indicator. This small "ball" is located at the bottom of your Primary Flight Display. Keeping it centered by applying the appropriate rudder input (pushing the pedal on the side the ball is deviating towards) will ensure coordinated flight, minimize drag, and allow for much more precise and stable tracking. Start with very small, gentle inputs and observe the aircraft's response.

Alright, let's go over your flight data. This is your first time in a real aircraft, and you did a great job maintaining your composure and keeping the aircraft safely in the air. That's a huge step, and I'm proud of you for that!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a stable tracking position directly behind the enemy aircraft at a consistent distance.

**How am I doing?**
For your first flight, you demonstrated good composure and maintained aircraft control without crashing, which is commendable. However, you consistently lost sight of the enemy and fell significantly behind due to difficulties maintaining position.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to master **proactive energy management and coordinated flight controls.** The most critical area is your throttle: you kept it at a constant setting, but when the enemy turns, you must add power by pushing the throttle forward. This increases your airspeed (KIAS, or Knots Indicated Airspeed) and provides the energy needed to turn with the enemy and prevent falling behind. This increased energy is vital for keeping up. Simultaneously, ensure your turns are coordinated by using appropriate rudder input along with your yoke (control stick) to keep the slip/skid ball centered on your G1000's Primary Flight Display (PFD). The "ball" is a small indicator, usually a white circle, located below the artificial horizon on your main screen; keep it centered using your rudder pedals (left pedal if the ball is left, right pedal if the ball is right). This will make your turns more efficient and prevent the frequent stall warnings you experienced from pulling back too hard on the yoke without enough speed. Remember, it's about smoothly blending power and control inputs to stay with the target.

Alright, Cadet, excellent work on your first tracking flight in the Cessna 172! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed initially, but you successfully kept the aircraft flying and demonstrated great effort in attempting to follow the target. That's a solid start!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain close, consistent visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively managing your aircraft's speed and position.

**How am I doing?**
You did well by staying airborne and not crashing, which is always the first priority! However, your flight data shows you consistently lost sight of the enemy aircraft, both vertically and horizontally, and experienced multiple stall warnings, indicating difficulty maintaining proper airspeed and relative position during the tracking maneuver.

**How to improve?**
Your most crucial area for improvement is **active throttle management**. Your throttle remained at a constant 50% throughout the entire flight. This means you weren't using engine power to control your airspeed or close the distance to the enemy. This directly led to your airspeed dropping too low during turns, triggering those stall warnings, and the distance to the enemy constantly increasing.

To improve, focus on this:
*   **Use the throttle to control your speed and distance:**
    *   **To close in on the enemy (decrease distance):** Smoothly and gradually push the throttle forward with your left hand. Watch your airspeed (KIAS) on the G1000 display; you want to increase speed to catch up.
    *   **To fall back or maintain distance (increase distance):** Smoothly and gradually pull the throttle back. This will reduce your speed and allow the enemy to pull away or help you maintain your current separation.
    *   **During turns:** When you initiate a turn to follow the enemy, your aircraft naturally wants to slow down. As you roll into the turn, smoothly add a bit of throttle to maintain your desired airspeed and prevent it from dropping too low, which can lead to a stall. Keep an eye on your KIAS to ensure it stays well above the stall warning speed.
*   **Practice smooth, subtle inputs:** Just like steering a car, small, continuous adjustments to the throttle are more effective than large, sudden movements. Think of feathering the power, constantly adjusting to keep your position relative to the target. This active use of the throttle will give you much better control over your flight path and relative position to the enemy.

Alright recruit, excellent work on your first tracking flight in the Cessna 172! It takes courage to get in the cockpit for the first time, and you did a great job reacting to the enemy's initial maneuver, which is a key skill. Most importantly, you kept the aircraft safe throughout the entire flight, and that’s always our top priority!

Here's your specific feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to consistently maintain visual track of the enemy aircraft, while safely managing your Cessna's flight performance.

**How am I doing?**
You reacted quickly when the enemy initiated its turn, which shows good potential for dynamic tracking. However, you consistently struggled to keep the enemy aircraft centered in your view, often losing sight in both pitch (up/down) and heading (left/right). The distance to the enemy also increased significantly throughout the exercise. Your control inputs, especially on the yoke for pitch and roll, were often too large and uncoordinated, leading to several stall warnings – that's when the wing angle to the air, called 'Angle of Attack' (AoA), becomes too high, risking a loss of lift. You also kept the throttle constant, which limited your ability to manage your speed relative to the target.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to refine your control inputs and actively manage your aircraft's energy. When maneuvering, apply smoother, more gradual inputs on the yoke for pitch and roll. Crucially, coordinate your turns by using the rudder pedals along with your yoke roll input to keep the "ball" centered on your G1000's turn coordinator; this prevents "sideslip," where the aircraft moves sideways through the air, ensuring efficient and stable turns. Simultaneously, you must actively use the throttle: increase power to accelerate and close the distance to the enemy, and reduce power when you need to slow down or tighten your turn to prevent overshooting. By smoothly integrating throttle, pitch, and coordinated roll, you’ll maintain better control, keep the enemy in sight, and avoid dangerous conditions like stalls.

Alright, Airman, excellent job getting into the cockpit for your first enemy tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, but you did a fantastic job of staying in the air and not crashing – that's a huge win for a first-timer! Your active control inputs show you're eager to learn and engage.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain a consistent visual track on the enemy aircraft, keeping it centered in your field of view and managing your distance.

**How am I doing?**
You initiated the tracking well before the enemy's turn. However, during and after the enemy's right turn, your distance to the target significantly increased, and you struggled to keep the enemy centered. This resulted in frequently losing sight of them in both pitch (pointing too high or low) and heading (pointing too far left or right). We also saw several 'stall warnings', which means your wing was close to losing lift because your Angle of Attack (AoA) was too high for your current airspeed.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, focus on actively managing your airspeed using the throttle. Your distance to the enemy grew significantly because your power setting (throttle ratio) remained constant at 0.5, which wasn't enough to match their movement. When the enemy starts to pull away, smoothly push the throttle lever forward to increase engine RPM and airspeed. This will allow you to close the distance and maintain a better tracking position. Conversely, if you find yourself getting too close, smoothly reduce the throttle. This dynamic throttle control is vital for maintaining a stable tracking solution.

**Instructor's Note on Speeding Up Feedback Generation:**

To speed up future feedback generation, I would implement an automated data analysis pipeline. This would involve:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Structuring:** Automatically loading the flight data into a structured format (e.g., a Pandas DataFrame) for easy manipulation.
2.  **Pre-defined Performance Metrics & Thresholds:** Establishing clear, quantifiable thresholds for "good," "might lose sight," and "lost sight" for pitch and heading deviation. Similarly, defining acceptable ranges for distance, rate of change of distance, AoA, and sideslip.
3.  **Automated Event Detection:** Programmatically identifying critical events such as enemy maneuvers, periods of high deviation, stall warnings (where `stall warning` = 1), and significant changes in distance.
4.  **Prioritization Algorithm:** Developing logic to identify the most impactful areas for improvement based on the frequency and severity of deviations or critical events.
5.  **Templated Feedback Generation:** Using pre-written sentence structures and explanations for common aviation terms, then dynamically inserting the analyzed metrics and identified issues into these templates.
6.  **Conciseness Filters:** Applying algorithms to ensure feedback remains succinct and adheres to word limits for specific sections.

This approach minimizes manual data interpretation and writing, allowing for rapid, consistent, and data-driven feedback.

Alright, cadet, let's review your enemy tracking flight in the Cessna 172. This was likely your first time handling a real aircraft in this scenario, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed. You showed great determination throughout the entire flight, which is a fantastic starting point for any pilot!

### What are my goals?
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy, ensuring stable, coordinated flight while tracking.

### How am I doing?
You demonstrated persistence in trying to track the enemy, which is commendable. However, your control inputs, especially with roll and pitch, were often delayed and overly aggressive, leading to frequent loss of sight and multiple stall warnings, indicated by the rapidly increasing distance.

### How to improve?
To improve, focus on smoother, more precise control inputs. When the enemy aircraft begins a turn, initiate your roll input immediately and gradually, using the yoke to match their bank angle. Crucially, coordinate your turns by applying appropriate rudder (foot pedals) simultaneously to keep the "ball" centered on the G1000's slip-skid indicator. This will prevent uncommanded yaw and excessive sideslip, which can lead to stalls. Additionally, you kept the throttle constant; actively adjust your throttle to manage your airspeed (KIAS) and energy, adding power to keep up or climb, and reducing it to slow down or descend, preventing stalls and improving tracking.

---

### How to speed up feedback generation:

To accelerate the feedback generation process, you can implement a more automated analysis pipeline:

1.  **Automated Data Parsing and Structuring:** Use a programming language (like Python with the Pandas library) to automatically load and parse your flight data. This will convert the dictionary into a structured format (like a DataFrame) that is much easier to analyze programmatically.
2.  **Define Performance Metrics and Thresholds:** Establish clear numerical thresholds for "good," "might lose sight," and "lost sight" for `pitch dev` and `heading dev`. Similarly, define thresholds for acceptable ranges for `roll`, `angle of attack`, and `sideslip angle`.
3.  **Develop Analysis Functions:** Write functions that automatically:
    *   Identify the different phases of the flight (e.g., "before manoeuvre," "enemy turning right," "enemy finished manoeuvre").
    *   Calculate key statistics for each phase (e.g., average `pitch dev`, maximum `roll`, total `stall warning` instances, overall change in `distance`).
    *   Detect specific issues (e.g., `if throttle_ratio` is constant, `if roll` or `pitch` values are extreme, `if stall_warning` is consistently active).
4.  **Implement Conditional Feedback Logic:** Based on the results from your analysis functions, use conditional statements (`if/else`) to select and combine pre-written feedback phrases. For example, if the analysis detects multiple stall warnings, the system would automatically pull the appropriate feedback sentence about managing AoA and airspeed. This allows for dynamic and tailored feedback without manual review of every data point.

By setting up this automated system, you can quickly process new flight data, identify key performance indicators, and generate specific feedback much faster than manual analysis.

Alright, Lieutenant, excellent effort on your first enemy tracking training flight! It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed with all the new sensations and controls, but you've taken the crucial first step into tactical aviation. Let's review your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft while effectively controlling your distance and aircraft energy.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated commendable persistence in attempting to track the enemy throughout the maneuver, which is a vital quality for any pilot. However, the data indicates that your control inputs were often delayed and abrupt, leading to significant distance increases and frequent loss of visual contact.

**How to improve?**
To improve, concentrate on **smooth, coordinated control inputs and active power management**. When the enemy initiates a turn, anticipate their maneuver and immediately apply gentle, simultaneous inputs to your yoke (for roll and pitch) and the appropriate rudder pedal to keep the "slip/skid ball" centered on your G1000 display. The slip/skid ball is a small black ball inside a curved tube, typically found at the bottom of your attitude indicator. Keeping it centered means your turns are "coordinated," preventing you from slipping or skidding through the air. Simultaneously, actively use your throttle to manage your energy; smoothly increase power to tighten your turn and prevent stall warnings, ensuring you maintain optimal airspeed to stay behind the target and close the distance. This integrated approach will help you maintain visual contact and effectively close the distance.

**Goals:** Maintain consistent visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, achieving precise flight control and coordinated turns for optimal pursuit.

**How am I doing?** You showed effort, but lost visual contact multiple times due to large pitch and heading deviations. Aggressive, uncoordinated control inputs also led to several stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
1.  **Smooth Control:** Initiate turns with gentle rudder (foot pedals) in the turn direction, then smooth aileron (yoke roll input) to roll. Keep the slip/skid ball (on your G1000 PFD) centered with rudder to maintain coordinated flight and prevent stalls (which happen when the wing's angle of attack is too high).
2.  **Anticipation:** Begin your turn slightly before the enemy finishes theirs. This smooths your transition, helping you maintain visual and reduce large deviations.

Alright, Trainee, great job on your first flight! It takes courage to get into the cockpit, and you successfully maintained control without crashing, which is the most important thing. Let's break down this flight and see how we can make you an even sharper tracker.

**What are my goals?**
To maintain precise visual track of the enemy aircraft while managing your aircraft's energy and controls effectively.

**How am I doing?**
You did well maintaining control and avoiding a crash, which is commendable for a first flight. However, your tracking was inconsistent, often losing sight of the enemy and falling significantly behind, especially during and after their right turn. For instance, when the enemy initiated its right turn around the 4-second mark, your aircraft rolled left, which is the opposite direction needed to follow. Your distance to the enemy increased from around 387 meters to over 9000 meters by the end, and you experienced multiple stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on executing coordinated turns using simultaneous aileron and rudder inputs to match the enemy's turn direction, while actively managing your airspeed with the throttle. When the enemy turns right, apply smooth right yoke (aileron) input to roll right, and simultaneously apply right rudder pressure with your foot to keep the "ball" centered on the G1000's slip/skid indicator – this ensures a coordinated turn. Concurrently, use the throttle to maintain your desired airspeed; adding power will help prevent stalls from excessive pitch inputs (pulling back on the yoke) and allow you to close distance, while reducing power can help you maintain distance.

Alright, listen up, future fighter pilots! That was your first real taste of tracking an enemy aircraft in a Cessna 172. It's a fundamental skill, and you've just taken a huge step. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact and optimal tracking distance to the enemy, ensuring safe, controlled flight.

**How am I doing?**
First, great job on keeping the aircraft safe throughout the flight and not crashing; that's paramount, especially for your first time. You maintained a consistent throttle setting, which shows consistency. However, during the enemy's right turn, you consistently applied left roll input, causing significant heading deviation and losing sight of the target. This led to erratic control inputs and multiple stall warnings as you tried to regain sight. You fell far behind the enemy due to ineffective tracking and power management.

**How to improve?**
1.  **Roll Control:** When the enemy aircraft turns right, you must match their turn by applying *right* roll with the yoke. Push the yoke right to roll right. If they turn left, push the yoke left to roll left. Anticipate their turns by observing their movement and immediately matching their roll direction.
2.  **Pitch and Angle of Attack:** After rolling into a turn, you'll need to pull the yoke back slightly to maintain altitude and keep the enemy centered vertically. However, avoid excessive pull; if you hear the stall warning horn – that's the alert that your wings are losing lift – immediately relax some back pressure on the yoke to decrease your Angle of Attack. The Angle of Attack (AoA) is simply the angle between your wing and the oncoming air; too high an AoA, and your wing stops producing lift, resulting in a stall.
3.  **Coordination (Sideslip):** You experienced significant sideslip angles, which means your turns were uncoordinated. Sideslip is when the aircraft's nose isn't perfectly aligned with its flight path, like skidding or slipping. To correct this, you need to use the rudder pedals. In a turn, apply rudder in the same direction you are rolling (e.g., right rudder for a right turn) to keep the ball centered on the G1000's slip/skid indicator. This ensures smooth, efficient turns.
4.  **Throttle Management:** Your throttle remained constant throughout the flight. To maintain tracking distance, you'll need to adjust your throttle. If the enemy is pulling away (distance increasing), increase throttle by pushing the throttle lever forward to gain speed. If you're getting too close, reduce throttle by pulling the lever back to slow down. KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed) on your G1000 will tell you your current speed.
5.  **Smooth Control Inputs:** Your inputs were quite large and abrupt after losing the enemy. Practice making smaller, smoother adjustments to the yoke for both pitch and roll, and integrate rudder use for coordinated flight. This will help you maintain a more stable platform for tracking.

You've got the basics, now let's refine those control inputs and get you locked onto that target! We'll work on this together next time.

Alright, that was your first real flight tracking an enemy, and it's a huge step! You kept the aircraft flying and didn't crash, which is excellent for a first-time experience. Let's break down the data.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal tracking position by precisely coordinating pitch, roll, and power inputs.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained control throughout the flight, which is excellent. However, the data shows you consistently lost sight of the enemy in both pitch and heading, causing the distance to increase significantly. We also saw multiple stall warnings, indicating you exceeded the critical angle of attack without proper energy management.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you need to actively manage your throttle and coordinate your turns. When the enemy initiates a turn, immediately advance your throttle to full power (all the way forward) to maintain airspeed and tighten your turn radius. Simultaneously, apply coordinated rudder input with your ailerons to keep the slip-skid indicator – that's the little 'ball' on your G1000 Primary Flight Display – centered. This ensures efficient turns and prevents you from slipping or skidding, which wastes energy and makes tracking harder. Avoid excessive back pressure on the yoke, especially in turns, to prevent stall warnings. We'll work on this next time.

Alright, cadet, first time in a real aircraft, and you're already tackling enemy tracking! That's impressive. I want to acknowledge your persistence throughout this flight; you kept trying to regain the target, and importantly, you brought the aircraft back safely. That's a solid foundation to build upon.

Here's your debrief:

**What are my goals?**
To consistently track the enemy by maintaining visual contact, executing coordinated turns, and managing airspeed to avoid stalls.

**How am I doing?**
You showed persistence, but struggled with coordinated control during the enemy's turn, leading to extreme attitudes, airspeed fluctuations, and multiple stall warnings.

**How to improve?**
To improve, focus on mastering smooth, coordinated turns with proper energy management: as the enemy begins a maneuver, smoothly apply appropriate aileron input in the direction of the turn, simultaneously adding just enough rudder to keep the 'slip/skid ball' (the black ball on the inclinometer within your G1000 Primary Flight Display) centered. Keeping that ball centered ensures you're not 'slipping' or 'skidding,' which means your aircraft isn't moving sideways through the air, causing unnecessary drag. As you roll into the turn, gently increase back pressure on the center stick to maintain your desired turn rate and prevent losing altitude, while simultaneously advancing the throttle to maintain your airspeed and prevent activating the stall warning. Remember, the stall warning indicates your wing is approaching an Angle of Attack (AoA) where it will stop producing sufficient lift, so maintaining adequate airspeed with throttle is critical during turns.

Alright, let's break down that flight. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed on your first real flight, especially when trying to track a moving target. You stepped into a cockpit, took the controls, and didn't crash – that's a huge win and shows you have excellent foundational composure!

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain constant visual contact with the enemy, minimizing distance and achieving smooth, coordinated flight.

**How am I doing?**
You did a great job maintaining initial control and avoiding a crash, which is paramount for a first flight. However, when the enemy aircraft initiated its right turn, you rapidly lost visual contact, indicated by your large heading and pitch deviations. Your distance from the enemy grew significantly, and you frequently activated the stall warning, showing uncoordinated flight and critically low airspeed during the critical phase of the manoeuvre.

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must refine your fundamental aircraft control by focusing on coordinated stick and throttle management. When the enemy initiates a turn, immediately roll *into* their turn using the center stick (e.g., push the stick right for a right turn), simultaneously applying the correct rudder to keep the slip/skid ball on the G1000's primary flight display centered. The slip/skid ball is like a level bubble; if the ball is to the left, press the left rudder pedal; if it's to the right, press the right rudder pedal. Crucially, as you turn, push the throttle forward to add power and maintain your airspeed (KIAS), preventing stalls and enabling tighter turns. Concurrently, manage your pitch with small, precise center stick inputs (pulling back to climb or pushing forward to descend) to avoid high angles of attack – the angle between your wing and the oncoming air – which triggered those stall warnings. This will help you keep the enemy centered vertically in your view.

Alright, trainee, welcome back! That was your first time tracking an enemy aircraft in a real plane, and it's a challenging task. You did a great job keeping the aircraft in the air and not crashing, especially during those moments when the stall warning activated. That shows you have a fundamental grasp of basic aircraft control, which is commendable for your first flight!

Here's your feedback:

**1. What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain optimal tracking position by precisely coordinating pitch, roll, and power to stay behind the enemy aircraft, avoiding stalls and excessive deviations.

**2. How am I doing?**
While you successfully kept the aircraft flying, your primary objective of maintaining a stable tracking position behind the enemy aircraft was not consistently met. Your distance from the target increased significantly, from 387m at the start of the enemy's right turn (around 4.38s) to over 650m by the end of it (around 15.39s), and continued to grow to over 9000m. This indicates you were unable to effectively match the enemy's turning radius or speed, leading to frequent "lost sight of enemy" indications for both pitch and heading deviation. Crucially, you experienced multiple stall warnings, for example, at 14.3s and 74.16s, indicating you were approaching or exceeding the wing's **critical angle of attack** – the point where the wing can no longer produce sufficient lift.

**3. How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to focus on smoother, coordinated control inputs and integrate power management. When the enemy aircraft began its right turn, your roll inputs were often large and sudden (e.g., -84.94 degrees at 14.3s) and you had significant **sideslip angles** (e.g., 8.91 degrees at 14.3s), indicating uncoordinated turns. For a coordinated turn, you must apply **aileron** (stick left/right) and **rudder** (foot pedals left/right) simultaneously. Imagine "stepping on the ball" on your G1000's slip/skid indicator – you want that little ball centered to ensure you're turning efficiently without **sideslip**, which is when the aircraft is moving somewhat sideways through the air. If the ball is to the right, push the right rudder pedal; if it's to the left, push the left rudder pedal. Additionally, your throttle remained constant; however, in a turn, you'll naturally lose **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed) due to increased drag. To maintain your speed and tighten your turn to stay with the enemy, you need to proactively **add throttle** (push the throttle lever forward) as you initiate and maintain your turn. If you hear the stall warning horn or feel the aircraft **buffet** (shake), immediately reduce your **angle of attack** (the angle between your wing and the oncoming air) by pushing the stick slightly forward and adding power to regain airspeed.

Alright, Airman, that was your first time in the cockpit, and you did a fantastic job staying calm and keeping us in the air for the whole flight – that's a huge accomplishment! Your basic control inputs were there, which is exactly what we need to build on. Let's break down the tracking exercise.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain optimal visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, staying within effective engagement parameters.

**How am I doing?**
You started well, but when the enemy initiated its right turn, your aircraft consistently rolled left or failed to initiate a timely right turn, causing you to lose horizontal sight (your "heading deviation" was significant) and greatly increase distance from the target.

**How to improve?**
To dramatically improve your tracking, you must immediately match the enemy's turn direction by rolling into the turn, and simultaneously adjust your pitch and power to maintain visual contact and distance. When the enemy turns right, apply right stick pressure to roll your wings right. As you roll, gently pull back on the stick (the "centre stick pitch ratio") to maintain your Angle of Attack – that's the angle between your wing and the oncoming air, crucial for lift – and prevent the nose from dropping too low (which is why you were often too low in "pitch deviation" and got stall warnings). Simultaneously, push the throttle forward to increase engine RPM ("throttle ratio"), giving you the power needed to sustain the turn and prevent the distance from increasing. If the stall warning activates (a horn or light indicating dangerously low airspeed for your current Angle of Attack), immediately ease forward on the stick to reduce your Angle of Attack and add full power to regain airspeed. We'll work on coordinating these inputs – roll, pitch, and power – as one fluid action to keep that target squarely in your sights.

Alright, pilot, excellent work on your first tracking flight in the Skyhawk! It's a big step getting into a real aircraft, and you handled it well. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to maintain the enemy aircraft within your gunsight by precisely coordinating pitch, roll, and power.

**How am I doing?**
You did well maintaining a stable flight path and airspeed during the initial straight-and-level portion of the flight, demonstrating solid foundational aircraft control. That's a great start!

**How to improve?**
To improve, you must proactively apply coordinated roll and power inputs: as the enemy begins its turn, roll the aircraft by pushing the center stick in the direction of their turn and use opposite rudder to keep the slip-skid ball centered. Simultaneously, advance the throttle to full power to maintain energy and close the distance, ensuring the target stays within your view.

---
**Key Terms Explained:**

*   **Center Stick**: This is the main control in front of you. Pushing it forward or backward controls your aircraft's **pitch** (nose up or down), and pushing it left or right controls your **roll** (how much your wings bank).
*   **Throttle**: The black lever to your right. Pushing it forward increases engine power and speed; pulling it back reduces power.
*   **Rudder Pedals**: The foot pedals on the floor. Pushing the left pedal moves the rudder left and makes the nose yaw left; pushing the right pedal does the opposite. They are essential for making **coordinated turns**.
*   **Coordinated Turn**: A smooth, balanced turn. When you bank with the center stick, you need to apply a little opposite rudder to keep the "slip-skid ball" (a small ball on your G1000 screen) centered. If the ball is off-center, it means you're slipping or skidding, which makes your turns less efficient and harder to track. Think "step on the ball" to center it.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA)**: This is the angle at which the wing meets the oncoming air. If your AoA gets too high, your wing can lose lift, which is called a **stall**.
*   **Stall Warning**: An alert (often an audible horn or a light) that tells you your aircraft is about to stall. You experienced this a few times, indicating you were pulling the nose up too aggressively without enough speed.
*   **KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed)**: Your speed shown on the G1000, measured in nautical miles per hour.
*   **Energy Management**: Skillfully using your throttle and pitch to control your aircraft's speed and altitude. To stay with a turning target, you often need to add power to maintain your speed and energy.
*   **Closure Rate**: How quickly the distance between your aircraft and the enemy is changing. If the distance is increasing rapidly (positive closure rate), you're falling behind.
*   **Gunsight / Visually Centered**: For this exercise, imagine a virtual aiming reticle. The goal is to keep the enemy aircraft precisely in the center of your view, both horizontally and vertically, like you're aiming at them.

Alright, Trainee Pilot, great work getting into the cockpit for your first tracking flight! It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed initially, but you've already taken the crucial first step. Let's break down your performance.

**What are my goals?**
Your primary goal is to consistently maintain visual contact with the enemy aircraft by matching its maneuvers and keeping it centered in your field of view.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained stable and steady flight during the initial phase before the enemy started its turn, which is an excellent foundation for a first flight. However, once the enemy initiated its right turn, your immediate response was delayed, and you struggled to match its maneuver, leading to a rapid increase in distance and several stall warnings as you tried to recover.

**How to improve?**
To improve your tracking, you need to focus on immediate and coordinated control inputs. When the enemy aircraft begins a turn, your first action must be to **roll** your aircraft in the **same direction** as the enemy using the center stick's roll axis. For example, if the enemy turns right, push the stick to the right to roll your wings right. As you roll, simultaneously and gently **pull back** on the stick (pitch up) to keep the enemy in your field of view, but be very mindful of your airspeed (KIAS on your G1000) and Angle of Attack (AoA). If your airspeed drops too low or the stall warning sounds (a horn you'll hear), immediately ease off the back pressure on the stick to regain speed and avoid a stall, then smoothly re-engage your turn once you're safely flying again. Remember: Roll to turn, then pitch to hold sight.

Alright, Trainee, great job on your first real flight! It takes courage to step into the cockpit, and you handled the aircraft safely, which is always paramount.

**What are my goals?**
Maintain constant visual contact and close distance to the enemy aircraft.

**How am I doing?**
You did an excellent job keeping the aircraft safe and avoiding a crash, which is a huge accomplishment for your first flight! However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy in both pitch (vertical aim) and heading (horizontal aim), and the distance between you consistently increased. Multiple stall warnings indicate you were pulling back too hard on the stick without enough power.

**How to improve?**
Your biggest area for improvement is throttle management. When the enemy begins its turn, immediately apply full throttle (push the throttle lever forward to 1.0) to maintain airspeed and energy. Coordinate this power with smooth, continuous roll inputs (moving the stick left/right) to match their turn, and gentle pitch adjustments (moving the stick forward/back) to keep them visually centered. If the stall warning activates, immediately push the stick forward to reduce your Angle of Attack (AoA – the angle of the wing to the airflow) and add full throttle to regain airspeed and control.

Alright, cadet, let's go over your first tracking flight. You did well not crashing – that's always job one!

**What are my goals?**
To maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy, precisely matching their maneuvers while smoothly managing your aircraft's energy.

**How am I doing?**
Excellent job on your first flight – no crash! However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy, especially during their right turn, due to over-controlling pitch (nose up/down) and heading (left/right). Your airspeed varied wildly, and you received several stall warnings (where airflow over wings reduces, threatening loss of lift).

**How to improve?**
When the enemy turns, immediately match their roll (wing tilt) by smoothly moving the stick right. Simultaneously, apply back pressure on the stick to maintain angle of attack (wing's bite into air). Critically, increase throttle to maintain airspeed and close distance. Use small, continuous adjustments, not large, jerky inputs. Remember, coordinated turns use both stick and rudder pedals to keep the turn smooth.

Alright, listen up, Lieutenant. First flight in a real bird, that's a big step! You did well staying airborne throughout the sortie, which is commendable for a first-timer. You also maintained a constant throttle setting, which is a good baseline.

**What are my goals?**
Maintain consistent visual tracking of the enemy aircraft, preventing stalls and managing distance.

**How am I doing?**
Excellent job staying airborne! You kept the throttle steady. However, you frequently lost sight of the enemy due to large pitch (nose up/down) and heading deviations. Your abrupt control inputs led to multiple stall warnings (aircraft losing lift) and increasing distance.

**How to improve?**
Focus on anticipating enemy movement. Apply smooth, small centre stick inputs. To correct pitch, gently push or pull. To correct heading, roll into the turn. Actively adjust throttle to manage airspeed and close distance, avoiding high Angle of Attack (AoA) that causes stalls.

Alright, Cadet, let's go over your performance. This is your first time in a real aircraft, and that's a big step. You kept the plane in the air, which is fundamental, so well done on that!

Before we dive into the feedback, let's clarify a few terms you'll hear today:
*   **Yoke:** In the Cessna 172, this is the control wheel you push/pull to control **pitch** (nose up/down) and turn left/right to control **roll** (wing tilt). The "centre stick" in your data refers to these yoke inputs.
*   **Throttle:** This lever controls engine power, directly affecting your **KIAS** (Knots Indicated Airspeed), which is your speed in nautical miles per hour.
*   **Roll:** Tilting the aircraft's wings left or right to initiate a turn.
*   **Pitch:** Moving the aircraft's nose up or down.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** The angle at which the wing meets the oncoming air. If it gets too high, the wing can lose lift, leading to a stall.
*   **Stall warning:** An audible horn in the Cessna 172 that sounds when your AoA is too high, indicating you're close to a stall and need to reduce pitch or increase power.
*   **Pitch deviation:** How far your aircraft's nose is pointing vertically relative to the target. Positive means you're too high.
*   **Heading deviation:** How far your aircraft's nose is pointing horizontally relative to the target. Positive means you're too far right.

Now, for your performance feedback:

**What are my goals?**
- Maintain visual contact by accurately matching the enemy's flight path and manage your distance for effective tracking.

**How am I doing?**
- You showed good initial stability and kept the aircraft safely airborne, but you lost consistent tracking and increased your distance from the enemy once they began their manoeuvre.

**How can I improve?**
- When the enemy turns, immediately apply correct roll and pitch inputs on the yoke to match their manoeuvre, and adjust throttle to maintain speed and close distance.

Here is your feedback, pilot:

What are my goals?
- To maintain close visual contact with the enemy aircraft by effectively managing your flight controls and power.

How am I doing?
- You demonstrated initial control stability, but struggled to maintain close visual contact with the enemy during their turn.

How can I improve?
- To maintain energy and track the enemy effectively, you must proactively increase throttle (push the lever forward, aiming for full power) when initiating turns to avoid airspeed loss and stall warnings.

What are my goals?
- To maintain precise tracking of the enemy aircraft by consistently applying timely and appropriate flight control inputs, ensuring safe and stable flight.

How am I doing?
You maintained a constant throttle setting and commendably avoided crashing despite entering a stall. However, you were not actively controlling the aircraft for the initial 12 seconds of the flight, allowing significant deviations in your flight path relative to the enemy aircraft.

*   **Throttle setting:** This refers to the engine's power level, controlled by the throttle lever. A constant setting means you kept the engine power steady.
*   **Deviations:** These are differences between your aircraft's position/attitude and the desired position/attitude relative to the enemy aircraft. Large deviations mean you were far off target.
*   **Stall:** A condition where the wings can no longer generate enough lift to support the aircraft's weight, often indicated by a "stall warning."

How can I improve?
You need to anticipate and respond to the enemy aircraft's maneuvers with immediate and coordinated control inputs. Specifically, when the enemy initiated its right turn at around 4.5 seconds, you should have smoothly applied right **roll** input with the center stick to bank the aircraft, simultaneously applying right **rudder** (foot pedals) to keep the nose aligned, and adjusting **pitch** (center stick forward/back) to maintain altitude and speed, preventing large deviations and avoiding uncoordinated flight that can lead to a stall.

*   **Anticipate:** To foresee or expect what the enemy aircraft will do next.
*   **Coordinated control inputs:** This means using the ailerons (via the center stick for roll), rudder (foot pedals for yaw), and elevator (via the center stick for pitch) together smoothly to achieve a desired maneuver without slipping or skidding.
*   **Roll:** The motion of the aircraft rotating around its nose-to-tail axis, controlled by the ailerons via the center stick.
*   **Rudder:** A control surface on the vertical tail that controls the aircraft's yaw (the nose moving left or right), operated by foot pedals.
*   **Pitch:** The nose-up or nose-down attitude of the aircraft, controlled by the elevator via the center stick.

Alright, recruit, this is your first time in the cockpit, so let's break down this flight data. Remember, our goal is to become proficient at tracking, which means keeping that enemy aircraft in your sights at all times.

You did a good job maintaining a steady flight path before the enemy aircraft started its maneuver. That shows you can keep the aircraft stable. However, let's look at how we can sharpen your tracking skills.

Here's your feedback:

**What are my goals?**
Maintain continuous visual contact with the enemy aircraft by proactively adjusting your aircraft's roll and pitch to match its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You maintained stable flight initially, but you delayed control inputs significantly when the enemy aircraft began its turn, quickly losing sight.

**How can I improve?**
When the enemy aircraft begins a right turn, immediately apply right aileron by moving the center stick to the right, and add back pressure by pulling the stick back to maintain sight.

**Explanation of terms:**
*   **Roll:** This is how your aircraft rotates around its nose-to-tail axis, like when you bank left or right. You control this with the **ailerons** by moving the **center stick left or right**.
*   **Pitch:** This is how your aircraft points its nose up or down, rotating around its wingtip-to-wingtip axis. You control this with the **elevator** by moving the **center stick forward or back** (pushing or pulling).
*   **Aileron:** Control surfaces on the outer part of the wings that cause the aircraft to roll.
*   **Back pressure:** Pulling the center stick back towards you, which pitches the nose of the aircraft up. This is crucial in a turn to prevent losing altitude and to keep the target in view.
*   **Center stick pitch ratio/roll ratio:** These numbers tell us how much you're moving the stick. A `0.0` means no input, while a `1.0` means you're pushing/pulling or moving the stick all the way to its limit.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** This is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air. If it gets too high, your wing can stop producing lift, which is a **stall**.
*   **Stall Warning:** An alarm that tells you your wing is about to stall. You want to avoid this unless specifically instructed for a maneuver.
*   **KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed):** Your speed as shown on the airspeed indicator in the cockpit.

Keep up the good work! We'll practice reacting quicker to those enemy maneuvers next time. You've got this.

Alright, Lieutenant, let's go over your first tracking flight. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed on your first time in a real aircraft, especially with an enemy on the loose! You did well to stay calm and avoid a crash, which is always the priority.

Here's your debrief:

**What are my goals?**
Your goal is to maintain constant visual contact and optimal tracking distance to the enemy aircraft throughout its maneuvers.

**How am I doing?**
You demonstrated good initial stability before the enemy aircraft started its maneuver. However, once the enemy initiated its right turn, you quickly lost sight of the target, and your distance increased dramatically. This was compounded by experiencing a stall warning and achieving an extreme, inverted bank angle, indicating a significant loss of control and energy during the maneuver.

**How to improve?**
To improve, your immediate focus must be on executing a timely and coordinated turn by simultaneously applying *right aileron* and *back pressure* on the *centre stick*, while also advancing the *throttle* to full power. When the enemy aircraft begins its right turn, immediately push your centre stick to the right to input *right aileron*, causing your aircraft to *bank* (tilt sideways) to the right. Simultaneously, gently pull the centre stick back (apply *back pressure*) to increase your *angle of attack* and maintain lift for the turn, but be careful not to pull too hard and induce a *stall*. Crucially, you must also immediately advance the *throttle* to full power (1.0 ratio) as soon as the enemy begins its turn to maintain your airspeed, which is critical for energy management and preventing stall warnings.

*   **Aileron:** These are control surfaces on the trailing edge of your wings that cause the aircraft to roll or bank. Pushing the stick right applies right aileron, making the right wing go down.
*   **Bank:** This is the angle at which your aircraft tilts sideways during a turn. A right bank means your right wing is lower than your left.
*   **Angle of Attack (AoA):** This is the angle between your wing and the oncoming air. Pulling back on the stick increases your AoA, which generates more lift for turning, but too much can lead to a stall.
*   **Stall:** This is when the airflow over your wings is disrupted, and they can no longer generate enough lift to support the aircraft. The stall warning horn indicates you are approaching this critical condition.
*   **Throttle:** This lever controls your engine's power. Advancing it forward increases power.

Next time, let's work on getting those coordinated turn inputs in early and smoothly. You've got this, Lieutenant!
